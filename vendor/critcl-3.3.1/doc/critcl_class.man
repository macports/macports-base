This document is the reference manpage for the [package critcl::class]
package. This package provides convenience commands for advanced
functionality built on top of the core.

[para] With it a user wishing to create a C level object with class
and instance commands can concentrate on specifying the class- and
instance-variables and -methods in a manner similar to a TclOO class,
while all the necessary boilerplate around it is managed by this
package.

[para] Its intended audience are mainly developers wishing to write
Tcl packages with embedded C code.

[para] This package resides in the Core Package Layer of CriTcl.

[call [cmd ::critcl::class::define] [arg name] [arg script]]

This is the main command to define a new class [arg name], where
[arg name] is the name of the Tcl command representing the class,
i.e. the [term {class command}]. The [arg script] provides the
specification of the class, i.e. information about included headers,
class- and instance variables, class- and instance-methods, etc.

See the section [sectref {Class Specification API}] below for the
detailed list of the available commands and their semantics.
