;
; This file defines the virtual base addresses for the Dynamic Link Libraries
; that are part of the Tcl system.  The first token on a line is the key (or name
; of the DLL) and the second token is the virtual base address, in hexidecimal.
; The third token is the maximum size of the DLL image file, including symbols.
;
; Using a specified "prefered load address" should speed loading time by avoiding
; relocations (NT supported only).  It is assumed extension authors will contribute
; their modules to this grand-master list.  You can use the dumpbin utility with
; the /headers option to get the "size of image" data (already in hex).  If the
; maximum size is too small a linker warning will occur.  Modules can overlap when
; they're mutually exclusive.  This info is placed in the DLL's PE header by the
; linker with the `-base:@$(TCLDIR)\win\coffbase.txt,<key>` option.
