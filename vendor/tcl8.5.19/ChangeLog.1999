1999-12-12  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/glob.n:
	* tests/fileName.test:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclEncoding.c:
	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: enhanced the glob command with the new options
	-types -path -directory and -join. Deprecated TclpMatchFiles with
	TclpMatchFilesTypes, extended TclGlob and TclDoGlob and added
	GlobTypeData structure. [Bug 2363]

1999-12-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/var.test:
	* generic/tclCompile.c: fixed problem where setting to {} array would
	intermittently not work. [Bug 3339] (Fontaine)

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: optimized INST_TRY_CVT_TO_NUMERIC to recognize
	boolean objects. [Bug 2815] (Spjuth)

	* tests/info.test:
	* tests/parseOld.test:
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c: changed Tcl_UplevelObjCmd (uplevel) and
	Tcl_EvalObjCmd (eval) to use TCL_EVAL_DIRECT in the single arg case as
	well, to take advantage of potential pure list input optimization.
	This means that it won't get byte compiled though, which should be
	acceptable.
	* generic/tclBasic.c: made Tcl_EvalObjEx pure list object aware in the
	TCL_EVAL_DIRECT case for efficiency.
	* generic/tclUtil.c: made Tcl_ConcatObj pure list object aware, and
	return a list object in that case [Bug 2098 2257]

	* generic/tclMain.c: changed Tcl_Main to not constantly reuse the
	commandPtr object (interactive case) as it could be shared. (Fellows)

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c: removed checking for compatible vfork function
	and use of the vfork function. Modern VM systems rarely suffer any
	performance degradation when fork is used, and it solves multiple
	problems with vfork. Users that still want vfork can add -Dfork=vfork
	to the compile flags. [Bug 942 2228 1312]

1999-12-09  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWinInit.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:

	longer officially supported, and likely didn't work anyway.
	* win/makefile.vc: removed 16 bit stuff, cleaned up.

	* win/tcl16.rc:
	* win/tclWin16.c:
	* win/winDumpExts.c: these files have been removed from the source
	tree (no longer necessary to build)

1999-12-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/io.test: removed 'knownBug' tests that were for unsupported0,
	which is now fcopy (that already has tests)

	* mac/tclMacPort.h: added utime.h include

	* generic/tclDate.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in: fixed make gendate to swap const with CONST so it
	uses the Tcl defined CONST type [Bug 3521]

	* generic/tclIO.c: removed panic that could occur in FlushChannel when
	a "blocking" channel would receive EAGAIN, instead treating it the
	same as non-blocking. [Bug 3773]

	* generic/tclUtil.c: fixed Tcl_ScanCountedElement to not step beyond
	the end of the counted string. [Bug 3336]

1999-12-03  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/load.n: added note about NT's buggy handling of './' with
	LoadLibrary

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: fixed error handling in http::Event. [Bug
	3752]

	* tests/env.test: removed knownBug limitation from working test
	* tests/all.tcl: ensured that ::tcltest::testsDirectory would be set
	to an absolute path

	* tests/expr-old.test:
	* tests/parseExpr.test:
	* tests/string.test:
	* generic/tclGet.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c:
	* generic/tclUtil.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: added TclCheckBadOctal routine to enhance
	error message checking for when users use invalid octal numbers (like
	08), as well as replumbed the Expr*Funcs with a new VerifyExprObjType
	to simplify type handling. [Bug 2467]

	* tests/expr.test:
	* generic/tclCompile.c: fixed 'bad code length' error for 'expr +
	{[incr]}' case, with new test case [Bug 3736] and seg fault on 'expr
	+ {[error]}' (different cause) that was caused by a correct
	optimization that didn't correctly track how it was modifying the
	source string in the opt. The optimization was removed, which means
	that:
		expr 1 + {[string length abc]}
	will be not be compiled inline as before, but this should be written:
		expr {1 + [string length abc]}
	which will be compiled inline for speed. This prevents:
		expr 1 + {[mindless error]}
	from seg faulting, and only affects optimizations for degenerate cases
	[Bug 3737]

1999-12-01  Scott Redman <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclMain.c:
	* unix/tclAppInit.c:
	* win/tclAppInit.c: Added two new internal functions,
	TclSetStartupScriptFileName() and TclGetStartupScriptFileName() and
	added hooks into the main() code for supporting TclPro and other "big"
	shells more easily without requiring a copy of the main() code.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c:
	* generic/tclEvent.c: Moved encoding-related startup code from
	tclEvent.c into the more appropriate tclEncoding.c.

1999-11-30  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c: fix from Kupries for	Tcl_UnstackChannel that
	correctly handles resetting translation and encoding.

	* generic/tclLoad.c: #def'd out the unloading of DLLs at finalize time
	for Unix in TclFinalizeLoad. [Bug 2560 3373] Should be parametrized
	to allow for user to specify unload or not.

	* win/tclWinTime.c: fixed handling of %Z on NT for time zones that
	don't have DST.

	* doc/http.n:
	* library/http2.1/http.tcl:

1999-11-18  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4: added defined for _THREAD_SAFE in --enable-threads
	case; added check for pthread_mutex_init in libc; in AIX case, with
	--enable-threads ${CC}_r is used; fixed flags when using gcc on SCO

1999-11-17 Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: Correctly fixed the -timeout problem
	mentioned in the 10-29 change. Also added error handling for failed
	writes on the socket during the protocol.

1999-11-09  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/open.n: corrected docs for 'a' open mode.

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: changed Tcl_Alloc to ckalloc

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c: rolled back changes from 1999-10-29
	Purify noted new leaks with that code

	* generic/tclParse.c: added code in Tcl_ParseBraces to test for
	possible unbalanced open brace in a comment

	* library/init.tcl: removed the installed binary directory from the
	auto_path variable

	* tools/tcl.wse.in: updated to 8.3a1, fixed install of twind.tcl and
	koi8-r.enc files

	* unix/tcl.m4: added recognition of pthreads library for AIX

1999-10-29  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h: Modified the TclNewObj and TclDecrRefCount in two
	ways. First, in the case of TCL_THREADS, we do not use the special
	Tcl_Obj allocator because that is a source of lock contention. Second,
	general code cleanup to eliminate duplicated code. In particular,
	TclDecrRefCount now uses TclFreeObj instead of duplicating that code,
	so it is now identical to Tcl_DecrRefCount.

	* generic/tclObj.c: Changed Tcl_NewObj so it uses the TclNewObj macro
	instead of duplicating the code. Adjusted TclFreeObj so it understands
	the TCL_THREADS case described above.

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: Fixed a bug in the handling of the
	state(status) variable when the -timeout flag is specified. Previously
	it was possible to leave the status undefined instead of empty, which
	caused errors in http::status

	portable).

	* generic/tclEnv.c: fixed possible ABR error in environ array

	* tests/scan.test:
	* generic/tclScan.c: added support for use of inline scan, XPG3
	currently not included

	* tests/incr.test:
	* tests/set.test:
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: fixed improper bytecode handling of 'eval
	{set array($unknownvar) 5}' (also for incr). [Bug 3184]

	* generic/tclCompile.c: removed savedChar trick that appeared to be
	causing a segv when the literal table was released

	indexing into one (test case string-5.16). [Bug 2871]

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: protected gets with catch. [Bug 2665]

1999-10-19  Jennifer Hom  <jenn@scriptics.com>

	* tests/tcltest.test:
	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest1.0/tcltest.tcl: Removed the extra return at the end
	of the tcltest.tcl file, added version information about tcl.

	Applied patches sent in by Andreas Kupries to add helper procs for
	debug output, add 3 new flags (-testsdir, -load, -loadfile), and
	internally refactors common code for dealing with paths into separate
	procedures. [Bug 2838, 2842]

	Merged code from core-8-2-1 branch that changes the checks for the
	value of tcl_interactive to also incorporate a check for the existence
	of the variable.

	* tests/autoMkindex.test:
	* tests/pkgMkIndex.test: Explicitly cd to ::tcltest::testsDirectory at
	the beginning of the test run

1999-08-01  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Added comment block to SocketThread() function.

	* tests/tcltest.test:
	* library/tcltest1.0/tcltest.tcl: Exit with non-zero status if there

	brackets. [Bug 2382, 2466]

1999-07-29  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c: Allow tcl to open CON and NUL, even for std
	channels. Checking for bad/unusable std channels was moved to Tk since
	its only purpose was to check whether to use the Tk Console Window for
	the std channels. [Bug 2393 2392 2209 2458]

	* unix/mkLinks.tcl: Applied patch to avoid linking pack.n to

1999-07-27  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* tools/tclSplash.bmp: Updated Windows installer bitmap to ready
	Tcl/Tk Version 8.2.

1999-07-26  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* tests/tcltest.test: Need to close the new core file, there seems to
	be a hang in threaded WinNT if the file isn't closed. Open issue, need
	to fix that hang.

	* tests/httpold.test: Add time delay in response from Http server so
	that test cases can properly detect timeout conditions with threads
	enabled on multi-CPU WinNT.

	* tests/winFCmd.test: Test case winFcmd-1.33 was looking for
	c:\windows, which may not exist. Instead, create a new directory on
	c:\ and use it for the test.

	* win/tclWinConsole.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinSock.c: Fix terminating helper threads by holding any
	mutexes from the primary thread while waiting for the helper thread to
	terminate. Without these changes, the test suite hangs on WinNT with 2
	CPUs and threads enabled. Open issue, seems to be a sporadic hang on
	dual CPU systems still (very rare).

1999-07-26  Jennifer Hom  <jenn@scriptics.com>

	* tests/tcltest.test:
	* library/tcltest1.0/tcltest.tcl:
	* doc/tcltest.n: Cleaned up code in ::tcltest::PrintError, revised

	* tests/info.test:
	* generic/tclParse.c: Removed patch for info command, breaks test
	cases on Unix. Patch was bad and needs to be redone properly. [Bug
	2382]

1999-07-22  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* Changed version to 8.2b2.

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Fixed hang with threads enabled, fixed semaphores
	with threads disabled.

	* win/safe.test: Fixed safe-6.3 with threads enabled.

	* win/Makefile.in: Fixed calling of tcltest to fix safe.test failures
	due to path TCL_LIBRARY path.

	* win/tclWinPort.h: Block out include of sys/*.h in order to build
	extensions with MetroWerks compiler for Win32. [Bug 2385]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclIO.c: Fix ANSI-style prototypes based on patch from
	Ulrich Ring. [Bug 2391]

	* unix/Makefile.in: Need to make install-sh executable before calling
	(with chmod +x). [Bug 2413]

	* tests/var.test:
	* generic/tclVar.c: Fixed bug that caused a seg. fault when using
	"array set a(b) {}", which is a bad array name anyway. Now the "array
	set" command will return an error in this case. Added test case and
	fixed existing test. [Bug 2427]

1999-07-21  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* tests/info.test:
	* generic/tclParse.c: Applied patch to fix "info complete" for the
	string {[a [b]}. Patch from Peter Spjuth. [Bug 2382]

	* doc/Utf.3:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclUtf.c: Changed function declarations in
	non-platform-specific public APIs to use "unsigned long" instead of
	"size_t", which may not be defined on certain compilers (rather than
	include sys/types.h, which may not exist).

	* unix/Makefile.in: Added the Windows configure script to the
	distribution file list, already shipping configure.in and the .m4
	files, but needed the configure script itself.

	* win/makefile.vc: Changed version number of DDE package in VC++
	makefile to use 1.1 instead of 1.0.

	* doc/open.n: Added documentation of \\.\comX notation for opening
	serial ports on Windows (alternative to comX:).

	* tests/ioCmd.test:
	* doc/open.n:
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Applied patch from Rolf Schroedter to add

	to move the handling of the socket event window in a separate thread.
	It also turned out that Win95 & Win98 were, in some cases, getting
	multiple FD_ACCEPTs but only handling one. Added a count for the
	FD_ACCEPT to take care of this. Tested on NT4 SP3, NT4 SP4, Win95, and
	Win98. [Bug 2178 2256 2259 2329 2323 2355]

1999-07-21  Jerry Peek  <jpeek@scriptics.com>

	* README: Small tweaks to clean up typos and wording.

1999-07-20  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclInitScript.h:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: merged code with 8.0.5. We now use an
	intermediate global tcl var "tclDefaultLibrary" to keep the
	"tcl_library" var from being set by the default value in the Makefile.
	Also fixed a bug in which caused the value of TCL_LIBRARY env var to
	be ignored.
	* unix/tclWinInit.c: just updated some comments.

1999-07-19  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	wording, fixed changebars, made two examples easier to read.

1999-07-11  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Since the makefile.vc should continue to work while
	we're working out bugs/issues in the new TEA-style
	autoconf/configure/gmake build mechanism for Windows, the version
	numbers of the Tcl libraries need to remain in sync. Modified the
	version numbers in the makefile to reflect the change to 8.2b1.

1999-07-09  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/configure.in: Eval DLLSUFFIX, LIBSUFFIX, and EXESUFFIX in the
	configure script so that substitutions get expanded before being
	placed in the Makefile. The "d" portion for debug libraries and DLLs
	was not being set properly.

1999-07-08  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/string.test:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Fixed bug in string range bounds checking code.

	for 1-letter flag abbreviations.

1999-07-08  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Added tcltest target so runtest works properly.
	Added missing names to the clean/distclean targets.

	* generic/rege_dfa.c: Applied fix supplied by Henry Spencer for bug in
	DFA state caching under lookahead conditions. [Bug 2318]

	* doc/fconfigure.n: Clarified default buffering behavior for the
	standard channels. [Bug 2335]

1999-07-06  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c: New implementation of serial port driver from
	Rolf Shroedter (Rolf.Schroedter@dlr.de) that allows more than one byte
	to be read from the port. Implemented using polling instead of
	threads, there is a max. 10ms latency between checking the port for
	file events. [Bug 1980 2217]

1999-07-06  Brent Welch  <welch@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.0/http.tcl: Fixed the -timeout option so it handles
	timeouts that occur during connection attempts to hosts that are down
	(the only case that really matters!)

1999-07-03  Brent Welch  <welch@scriptics.com>

	* doc/ChnlStack.3:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclIO.c: Added a new variant of the "Trf patch" from Andreas

	* generic/tclNotify.c:
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:
	* unix/tclXtTest.c:
	* unix/tclXtNotify.c:
	* win/tclWinNotify.c:
	* mac/tclMacNotify.c: Added Tcl_SetNotifier and the associated hook
	points in the notifiers to be able to replace the notifier calls at
	runtime. The Xt notifier and test program use this hook.

1999-07-03  Brent Welch  <welch@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclParse.c: Changed parsing of variable names to allow empty
	array names. Now "$(foo)" is a variable reference! Previous you had to
	use something like $::(foo), which is slower. This change is requested
	by Jean-Luc Fontaine for his STOOOP package.

1999-07-01  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* generic/tclFCmd.c: Call TclStat instead of TclpStat in order to

	* tests/all.tcl: Added -preservecore, -limitconstraints, -help, -file,
	-notfile, -relateddir and -asidefromdir flags to the tcltest package
	along with exported proc ::tcltest::getMatchingFiles. The
	documentation was modified to match and all.tcl was modified to use
	the new functionality instead of implementing -file itself.

1999-06-28  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c:
	* doc/GetIndex.3:
	* tests/binary.test:
	* tests/winDde.test: Applied patch from Peter Hardie (with changes) to
	fix problem with Tcl_GetIndexFromObj() when the key being passed is
	the empty string. It used to match "" and return TCL_OK, but it should
	have returned TCL_ERROR instead. Added test case to "binary" and "dde"
	commands to check the behavior. Added documentation note as well.

1999-06-26  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinDde.c: Applied patch from Peter Hardie to add poke command

	* library/tcltest1.0/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/tcltest1.0/tcltest.tcl:

	harness package. This package was based on the defs.tcl file that was
	part of the tests directory. Reversed the way that tests were
	evaluated to fix a problem with false passes.

	* doc/tcltest.n: Added documentation for the tcltest package.

	* tests/README:
	* tests/defs.tcl:
	* tests/all.tcl: Modified all test files (tests/*.test) and all.tcl to
	use the new tcltest package and removed references to the defs.tcl
	file. Modified the README file to point to the man page for tcltest.

1999-06-25  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/reg.test:
	* generic/regexec.c: Fixed bugs in non-greedy quantifiers.

	* tests/regexp.test:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c: Changed to use new regexp interfaces. Added
	-expanded, -line, -linestop, and -lineanchor switches to regsub.

	* generic/tclRegexp.c:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Renamed Tcl_RegExpMatchObj to Tcl_RegExpExecObj
	and added a new Tcl_RegExpMatchObj that is equivalent to
	Tcl_RegExpMatch. Added public macros for the regexp compile/execute
	flags. Changed to store either an object pointer or a string pointer
	in the TclRegexp structure. Changed to avoid adding a reference to the
	object or copying the string.

	* generic/regcomp.c: lint

	* tests/reg.test:
	* generic/regex.h:
	* generic/regc_lex.c: Added REG_BOSONLY flag to allow Expect to
	iterate through a string an only find matches that start at the
	current position within the string.

1999-06-16  Michael Thomas  <wart@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/aclocal.m4: Numerous build changes to make Tcl conform to the
	proposed TEA spec

1999-06-16  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_VariableObjCmd): fixed premature increment in
	loop that was causing out-of-bounds reads on array "varName".

1999-06-16  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/execute.test:
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Fixed crash caused by a
	bug in INST_LOAD_SCALAR1 where the scalar index was read as a signed 1
	byte value instead of unsigned. [Bug 2243]

1999-06-14  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* doc/StringObj.3
	* test/stringObj.test
	* unix/Makefile.in
	* win/Makefile.in
	* win/makefile.vc
	* generic/tclStringObj.c:
	Merged String and Unicode object types. Added new functions to the
	puplic API: Tcl_NewUnicodeObj, Tcl_SetUnicodeObj, Tcl_GetUnicode,
	Tcl_GetUniChar, Tcl_GetCharLength, Tcl_GetRange,
	Tcl_AppendUnicodeToObj.

1999-06-09  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclUnicodeObj.c: Lots of cleanup and simplification. Fixed
	several memory bugs. Added TclAppendUnicodeToObj.

	* generic/tclInt.h: Added declarations for various Unicode string
	functions.

	* generic/tclRegexp.c:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Changed to use new Unicode string interfaces for
	better performance.

	* generic/tclRegexp.h:
	* generic/tclRegexp.c:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Added Tcl_RegExpMatchObj and Tcl_RegExpGetInfo
	calls to access lower level regexp API. These features are needed by
	Expect. This is a preliminary implementation pending final review and
	cleanup.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* tests/string.test: Fixed bug where string map failed on null strings

	* generic/regexec.c:
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: lint

	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Changed to always write output in LF mode.

1999-06-08  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Rolled back to the 8.1.0 implementation because of
	serious problems with the new driver. Basically no incoming socket
	connections would be reported to a server port. The 8.1.1 code needs
	to be redesigned and fixed correctly.

1999-06-07  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* tests/string.test:
	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_SetVar2Ex):
	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_AppendObjToObj):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): optimized the string index,
	string length, string range, and append command in cases where the
	object's internal rep is a bytearray. Objects with other internal reps
	are converted to have the new unicode internal rep.

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.vc:
	* tests/unicode.test:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* generic/tclUnicodeObj.c: added a new object type to store the
	unicode representation of a string.

	* generic/tclTestObj.c: added the objtype option to the testobj
	command. This option returns the name of the type of internal rep an
	object has.

1999-06-04  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/configure.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Windows build now handles static/dynamic
	debug/nodebug builds and supports the standard targets using Cygwin
	user tools plus GNU make and autoconf.

1999-06-03  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd):
	* tests/string.test: Fixed bug where string equal/compare -nocase
	reported wrong result on null strings. [Bug 2138]

1999-06-02  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UtfNcasecmp): Fixed incorrect computation of
	relative ordering. [Bug 2135]

1999-06-01  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in: Fixed various small configure.in patches
	submitted by Jan Nijtmans. [Bug 2121]

	* tests/reg.test:
	* generic/regc_color.c:
	* generic/regc_cvec.c:

	* generic/regguts.h:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclRegexp.c:
	* generic/tclRegexp.h:
	* generic/tclTest.c: Applied Henry Spencer's latest regexp patches
	that fix an infinite loop bug and add support for testing whether a
	string could match with additional input. [Bug 2117]

1999-05-28  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclObj.c: Changed to eliminate use of isupper/tolower in
	favor of the Unicode versions.

	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/configure.in: Added preliminary TEA implementation.

	* win/tclWinDde.c: Fixed bug where dde calls were being passed an
	invalid dde handle because Initialize had not been called. [Bug 2124]

1999-05-26  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptic.com>

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c: Fixed race condition in testthread code
	that showed up in the WinNT test suite intermittently.

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Fixed a hang in the WinNT socket driver, wake up
	the socket thread every 100ms to check for events on the sockets that
	did not wake up the thread (race condition).

1999-05-24  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Changed to allow a list of platforms instead of
	just one at a time.

	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclPort.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclStubLib.c: Various header file related changes and other
	lint to try to get the Mac builds working.

1999-05-21  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: Fix bug when launching command.com on Win95/98.
	Need to wait for the procInfo.hProcess of the process that was
	created, not the hProcess of the current process. [Bug 2105]

1999-05-20  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* library/init.tcl: Add the directory where the executable is, and the
	../lib directory relative to that, to the auto_path variable.

1999-05-19  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	Merged in various changes submitted by Jeff Hobbs:

	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclUtf.c: Added Tcl_UniCharIs* functions for control, graph,
	print, and punct classes.

	* generic/tclUtil.c:
	* doc/StrMatch.3: Added Tcl_StringCaseMatch() implementation to
	support case-insensitive globbing.

	* doc/string.n:
	* unix/mkLinks:
	* tests/string.test:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Added additional character class tests, added
	-nocase switch to "string match", changed string first/last to use
	offsets.

1999-05-19  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tcl.h: Add extern "C" block around entire header file for
	C++ compilers to fix linkage issues. Submitted by Don Porter and Paul
	Duffin.

	* generic/tclRegexp.c: Fix bug when the regexp cache is empty and an
	empty pattern is used in regexp ( such as {} or "" ).

1999-05-18  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c: Modified initialization code to avoid inherenting
	closed or invalid channels. If the standard input is anything other
	than a console, file, serial port, or pipe, then we fall back to the
	standard Tk window console.

1999-05-14  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_ForObjCmd): Fixed crash caused by failure to
	reset the result before evaluating the test expression.

1999-05-14  Bryan Surles  <surles@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp): Added introspection variable
	for threaded interps. If the interp was compiled with threads enabled,
	the tcl_platform(threaded) variable will exist.

1999-05-14  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclDate.c: Applied patch to fix 100-year and 400-year
	boundaries in leap year code, from Isaac Hollander. [Bug 2066]

1999-05-13  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/tclAppInit.c: Minor cleanup related to Xt notifier.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings): Tcl now looks for an
	encoding subfield in the LANG/LC_ALL variables in cases where the
	locale is not found in the locale table. Ensure that setlocale() is
	called at least once so X11 will initialize properly. Also, forces the
	LC_NUMERIC locale to be "C" so numeric processing in scripts is not
	affected by the current locale setting. [Bug 1989]

	* generic/tclRegexp.c: Increased per-thread regexp cache to 30 slots.
	This seems to be about the right number for larger applications like
	exmh. [Bug 1063]

1999-05-12  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* doc/tclsh.1: Updated references to rc script names to accurately
	reflect the platform differences on Windows.

	* tests/regexp.test:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclRegexp.h:
	* generic/tclRegexp.c: Replaced the per-interpreter regexp cache with
	a per-thread cache. Changed the Regexp object to take advantage of
	this extra cache. Added a reference count to the TclRegexp type so
	regexps can be shared by multiple objects. Removed the per-interp
	regexp cache from the interpreter. Now regexps can be used with no
	need for an interpreter. [Bug 1063]

	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpSetVariables): Avoid calling GetUserName if
	the value can be determined from the USERNAME environment variable.
	GetUserName is very slow.

1999-05-07  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/winDumpExts.c:
	* win/makefile.vc: Removed incorrect patch. [Bug 1998]

	* generic/tcl.decls: Replaced const with CONST.

	* generic/tclResult.c (Tcl_AppendResultVA):
	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_AppendStringsToObjVA): Fixed to copy
	arglist using memcpy instead of assignment so it works properly on
	OS/390. [Bug 1997]

	* generic/tclLoadNone.c: Updated to use current interfaces, added
	TclpUnloadFile. [Bug 2003]

	* win/winDumpExts.c:
	* win/makefile.vc: Changed to emit library name in defs file. [Bug
	1998]

	* unix/configure.in: Added fix for OS/390. [Bug 1976]

1999-05-06  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/string.test:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* doc/string.n: Fixed bug in string equal/compare code when using
	-length option. Cleaned up docs a bit more.

	* tests/http.test: Unset "data" array before running tests to avoid
	failures due to previous tests.

	* doc/string.n:
	* tests/cmdIL.test:
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:
	* tests/error.test:
	* tests/ioCmd.test:
	* tests/lindex.test:
	* tests/linsert.test:
	* tests/lrange.test:
	* tests/lreplace.test:
	* tests/string.test:
	* tests/cmdIL.test:
	* generic/tclUtil.c:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Replaced "string icompare/iequal" with -nocase
	and -length switches to "string compare/equal". Added a -nocase option
	to "string map". Changed index syntax to allow integer or
	end?-integer? instead of a full expression. This is much simpler with
	safeTcl scripts since it avoids double substitution issues.

	* doc/Utf.3:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclUtf.c:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Added Tcl_UtfNcmp and Tcl_UtfNcasecmp.

1999-05-05  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Added encoding directory to install-libraries
	target.

1999-05-03  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* doc/string.n:
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:
	* tests/string.test:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): Changed "string length" to
	avoid regenerating the string rep of a ByteArray object.

	* tests/cmdIL.test:
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:
	* tests/error.test:
	* tests/lindex.test:
	* tests/linsert.test:
	* tests/lrange.test:
	* tests/lreplace.test:
	* tests/string.test:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd):
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclGetIntForIndex): Applied Jeff Hobbs's string
	patch which includes the following changes [Bug 1845]:
	- string compare now takes optional length arg (for strncmp behavior)
	- added string equal (just a few lines of code blended in with string
	  compare)
	- added string icompare/iequal for case-insensitive comparisons
	- string index's index can now be ?end[+-]?expression
	  I made this change in the private TclGetIntForIndex, which means
	  that the list commands also benefit, as well as string range, et al.
	- added [string repeat string count]
	  Repeats given string number of times
	- added string replace, string equiv to lreplace
	  (quasi opposite of string range):
		string replace first last ?string?
	  Example of use, replacing end of string with ... should the string
	  be more than 16 chars long:
		string replace $string 16 end "..."
	  This just returns the string len < 16, so it will only affect the
	  long strings.
	- added optional first and last args to string to*
	  This allows you to just affect certain regions of a string with the
	  command (like just capping the first letter). I found the original
	  totitle to be too draconian to be useful.
	- added [string map charMap string]
	  where charMap is a {from to from to} list that equates to what one
	  might get from [array get]. Each and can be multiple chars (or none
	  at all). For Tcl/CGI users, this is a MAJOR speed booster.

	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_ParseCommand): Changed to avoid modifying
	eval'ed strings that are already null terminated. [Bug 1793]

	* tests/binary.test:
	* generic/tclBinary.c (DupByteArrayInternalRep): Fixed bug where type
	was not being set in duplicated object. [Bug 1975, 2047]

1999-04-30  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* Changed version to 8.1.1.

1999-04-30  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* Merged changes from 8.1.0 branch:

	* generic/tclParse.c: Fixed memory leak in CommandComplete.

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Added 'extern "C" {}' block around the stub
	table pointer declaration so the stub library can be used from C++.
	[Bug 1934]

	* Lots of documentation and other release engineering fixes.

1999-04-28  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* mac/tclMacResource.c:
	* generic/tclListObj.c:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c: Changed to avoid freeing the string
	representation before freeing the internal rep. This helps with
	debugging since the string rep will still be valid when the free proc
	is invoked.

1999-04-27  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclLiteral.c (TclHideLiteral): Fixed so hidden literals get
	duplicated to avoid accidental sharing in the global object table.

1999-04-23  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Changed to avoid the need for forward
	declarations in stub initializers.

1999-04-23  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* library/encoding/koi8-r.enc:
	* tools/encoding/koi8-r.txt: Added support for the koi8-r Cyrillic
	encoding. [Bug 1771]

1999-04-22  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: Changed uses of "try" to "__try", since that is
	the actual keyword. This eliminates the need for some -D flags from
	the makefile.

	* generic/tclPort.h: Added include of tcl.h since it defines various
	Windows macros that are needed before deciding which platform porting
	file to use.

	* generic/tclEvent.c: lint

	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitPlatform): Added call to TclWinInit when
	building a static library since DllMain will not be invoked. This
	could break old code that explicitly called TclWinInit, but should be
	simpler in the long run.

1999-04-22  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclCompile.c: Added TclSetByteCodeFromAny that takes a hook
	procedure to invoke after compilation but before the byte codes are
	emitted. This makes it possible to do postprocessing on the compiled
	byte codes before the ByteCode is generated.

	* generic/tclLiteral.c: Added TclHideLiteral and TclAddLiteralObj to
	make it possible to create local unshared literal objects.

	* win/tclWinInit.c:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: Changed initial search path to match that
	found used by tcl_findLibrary.

1999-04-22  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinPort.h:
	* win/tclWinSock.c: Added code to use WinSock 2.0 API on NT to avoid
	creating a window to handle sockets. API not available on Win95 and
	needs to be fixed on Win98, until then continue to use the older
	(window-based) scheme on those two OSes.

1999-04-15  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* Merged 8.1 back into the main trunk

1999-04-13  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* library/encoding/gb2312.enc:
	* library/encoding/euc-cn.enc:
	* tools/encoding/gb2312.txt:
	* tools/encoding/cp950.txt:
	* tools/encoding/Makefile: Restored the double byte definition of
	GB2312 and added the EUC-CN encoding. EUC-CN is a variant of GB2312
	that shifts the characters into bytes with the high bit set and
	includes ASCII as a subset. [Bug 632]

1999-04-13  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Apply patch to allow write access to a socket if
	FD_WRITE is sent but FD_CONNECT is not. Some strange problem with
	either Win32 or a socket driver. [Bug 1664 1776]

1999-04-09  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: Fixed notifier deadlock situation when the pipe
	used to talk back notifier thread is filled with data. When calling
	the write() function to feed data down that pipe, unlock the
	notifierMutex to allow the notifier to wake up again. Found as a
	result of the focus.test for Tk hanging. [Bug 1700]

1999-04-06  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/unixNotfy.test: Fixed hang in tests when built with thread
	support.

	* tests/httpold.test: Fixed broken test that didn't wait long enough
	for events to arrive.

	* tests/unixInit.test: Fixed race condition in test.

	* tests/unixInit.test:
	* tests/fileName.test: Minor test nits.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings): Fixed bad initial
	encoding string.

1999-04-06  Bryan Surles  <surles@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclVar.c:
	* generic/tclEnv.c: Moved the "array set" C level code into a common
	routine (TclArraySet). The TclSetupEnv routine now uses this API to
	create an env array w/ no elements.

	* generic/tclEnv.c:
	* generic/tclWinInit.h:
	* generic/tclUnixInit.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h: Made the Env module I18N compliant. Changed the
	FindVariable routine to TclpFindVariable, that now does a case
	insensitive string comparison on Windows, and not on UNIX. [Bug 1299,
	1500]

1999-04-05  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/io.test: Minor test cleanup.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (Tcl_CreateEncoding): Minor lint to make it
	easier to compile on Digital-unix. [Bug 1659]

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: Applied patch for OS/390 to handle lack of
	sys/param.h. [Bug 1725]

	* unix/configure.in: Fixed BSD/OS 4.* configuration to support shared
	libraries properly. [Bug 1730]

1999-04-05  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinDde.c: decrease timeout value for DDE calls to 30k. [Bug
	1639]

	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclUtil.c: Added more functions to the Tcl stubs table,
	including all Tcl_ functions not already in it (except Cmd functions)
	and Tcl_GetCwd() and Tcl_Chdir() (new functions).

	* tests/safe.test:
	* doc/safe.n:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* library/safe.tcl: The encoding command is not safe as-is, so create
	a safe alias to mask out the "encoding system <name>" but allow all
	other uses including "encoding system". Added test cases and updated
	the man page for Safe Tcl.

1999-04-05  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/winTime.test:
	* win/tclWinTime.c: Fixed crash in clock command that occurred when
	manipulating negative time values in timezones east of GMT. [Bug
	1142, 1458]

	* tests/platform.test:
	* tests/fileName.test: Fixed broken tests.

	* generic/tclFileName.c: Moved global regexps into thread local
	storage.

	* tests/socket.test: Changed so tests don't reuse sockets, since
	Windows is slow to release sockets.

	* win/tclWinConsole.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Fixed race condition where background threads
	were terminated while they still held a lock in the notifier.

1999-04-02  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/http.test: Fixed bad test initialization code.

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c (ThreadExitProc): Fixed bug where static
	memory was being returned instead of a dynamically allocated result in
	error cases.

1999-04-02  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* doc/dde.n:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* win/tclWinDde.c: Add new DDE package, code removed from Tk now
	separated into its own package. Changed DDE-based send code into "dde
	eval" command. Can be loaded into tclsh (not just wish). Windows only.

1999-04-02  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/expr.test:
	* tests/for-old.test:
	* tests/for.test:

	knownBug constraint), and cleaned up a few bad tests.

	* generic/regc_locale.c:

1999-04-01  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/registry.test:
	* win/tclWinReg.c: Internationalized the registry code. It now uses
	Unicode interfaces on NT. [Bug 1197]

	* tests/parse.test:
	* generic/tclParse.c: Fixed crash due to multiple frees in parser
	during error cleanup when parsing commands with more tokens than will
	fit in the static area of the parse structure. [Bug 1681]

	* generic/tclInt.h: Removed duplicate declarations.

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Added Tcl_WinUtfToTChar and Tcl_WinTCharToUtf to
	the tclPlat table.

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/StubInit.c:
	* tools/genStubs.tcl:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc: Applied patch from Jan Nijtmans to fix Ultrix
	multiple symbol definition problem. Now, even Tcl includes a copy of
	the Tcl stub library. Also fixed TCL_MEM_DEBUG mode (for Tk).

1999-03-31  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinConsole.c: WinNT has a bug when reading a single character
	from the console. Rewrote the code for the console to read an entire
	line at a time using the reader thread.

1999-03-30  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Removed trailing backslash that broke the "depend"
	target.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings): Changed to avoid
	calling setlocale(). We now look directly at env(LANG) and
	env(LC_CTYPE) instead. [Bug 1636]

	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Removed CONST from Tcl_JoinPath and
	Tcl_TranslateFileName because it changes the signature of Tcl_JoinPath
	in an incompatible manner.

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclLoad.c (TclFinalizeLoad):
	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): Defer unloading of loadable
	modules until all exit handlers have been invoked. [Bug 998, 1273,
	1573, 1593]

1999-03-29  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Added CONST to Tcl_JoinPath and

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: Removed the stub functions and changed
	the stub macros to just use the name without params. Pass &tclStubs
	into the interp (don't use tclStubsPtr because of collisions with the
	stubs on Solaris).

1999-03-27  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.bc: Removed makefile for Borland compiler, no longer
	supported.

1999-03-26  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c:
	* win/tclWinConsole.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c: Don't close the Win32 handle for a channel if it's
	a stdio handle (GetStdHandle()) during shutdown of a thread to prevent
	it from destroying the stdio of other threads.

1999-03-26  Suresh Ankolekar  <suresh@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in: --nameble-shared is now the default and build Tcl
	as a shared library; specify --disable-shared to build a static Tcl
	library and shell.

1999-03-25  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/interp.test:
	* generic/tclInterp.c (AliasObjCmd): Changed so aliases are invoked at
	current scope in the target interpreter instead of at the global
	scope. This was an incompatibility introduced in 8.1 that is being
	removed. [Bug 1153, 1556]

	* library/encoding/big5.enc:
	* library/encoding/gb2312.enc:
	* tools/encoding/big5.enc:
	* tools/encoding/gb2312.enc: Added ASCII to big5 and gb2312 encodings.
	[Bug 632]

	* generic/tclPkg.c (Tcl_PkgRequireEx): Fixed broken clientData
	initialization in package code.

	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): Added tcl.decls and tclInt.decls to source
	distribution. [Bug 1571]

	* doc/Thread.3: Updated documentation of Tcl_MutexLock to indicate
	that the recursive locking behavior is undefined. On Windows, it does
	not block, on Unix it deadlocks. [Bug 1275]

1999-03-24  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/execute.test:
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Fixed expression code
	that incorrectly returned floating point values for integers if the
	internal rep happened to be a double. Now we check to see if the
	object has a string rep that looks like an integer before using the
	double internal rep. [Bug 1516]

1999-03-24  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclAlloc.c:
	* generic/tclEncoding.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* unix/tclUnixTime.c:
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Fixed compilation warnings/errors for VC++ 5.0
	and 6.0 and HP-UX native compiler without -Aa or -Ae. [Bug 1323 1518
	1324 1583 1585 1586]

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Make sockets thread-safe on Windows. The current
	implementation uses windows to handle events on the socket, one for
	each thread (thread local storage). Previously, there was only one
	window shared between threads, which didn't work. [Bug 1326]

1999-03-23  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tools/tcl.wse: Fixed file association to look in the right place for
	the wish icon. [Bug 1544]

	* tests/winNotify.test:
	* tests/ioCmd.test:
	* tests/event.test: Changed to use new style conditionals.

	* tests/encoding.test: Fixed nonportable test.

	* unix/dltest/configure.in:
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: Added missing DBGX macros. [Bug 1564]

	* tests/winNotify.test:
	* mac/tclMacNotify.c:
	* win/tclWinNotify.c:
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:
	* generic/tclNotify.c: Added a new Tcl_ServiceModeHook interface that
	is invoked whenever the service mode changes. This is needed to allow
	the Windows notifier to create a communication window the first time
	Tcl is about to enter an external modal event loop instead of at
	startup time. This will avoid the various problems that people have
	been seeing where the system hangs when tclsh is running outside of
	the event loop. [Bug 783]

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Renamed TclpAlertNotifier back to
	Tcl_AlertNotifier since it is part of the public notifier driver API.

1999-03-23  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Fixed problem with fileevent on the serial port
	and nonblocking mode. Gets no longer hangs, fileevents fire whenever
	there is any character data on the port.

	* tests/winConsole.test:
	* win/tclWinConsole.c: Fixed problem with fileevents and gets from a
	console stdin. Previously, fileevents were firing before an entire
	line was available for reading, which meant that when you did a gets
	or read, it blocked (even in nonblocking mode). Now, it should work
	the same as Unix: fileevents fire when an entire line is ready, and
	gets and read do not block in non-blocking mode. Added an interactive
	test case to check for this.

1999-03-22  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/reg.test:
	* generic/regc_color.c: Applied regexp bug fix from Henry Spencer.

1999-03-19  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c: Fixed the initialization of an array so that the
	Sun 5.0 C compiler wouldn't complain.

	* unix/configure.in: Added support for --enable-64bit. For now, this
	is only supported on Solaris 7 64bit (SunOS 5.7) using the Sun
	compiler (not gcc).

1999-03-18  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c (TclpOpenFileChannel, Tcl_MakeFileChannel): Changed
	to only test for console or comm handles when the type is
	FILE_TYPE_CHAR to avoid useless tests on simple files. Also reordered
	tests so consoles are tested first as this is more common.

	* win/makefile.vc: Regularized usage of mkd and rmd and rm.

	* library/encoding/shiftjis.enc:
	* tools/encoding/shiftjis.txt: Missing/incorrect characters in
	shift-jis table. [Bug 1008, 1526]

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Eliminated use of "string" and "list" from
	argument lists to avoid conflicts with C++ STL. [Bug 1181]

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpMatchFiles): Changed to ignore the
	FS_CASE_IS_PRESERVED bit and always return exactly what we get from
	the system.

1999-03-17  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/README.binary:
	* win/README:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* README: Updated version to 8.1b3.

1999-03-14  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/tclWinConsole.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Changed so channel drivers wait for the
	reader/writer threads to exit before returning during a close
	operation. This ensures that the main thread is the last thread to
	exit, so the process return value is set properly.

	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatStubs.c:
	* generic/tclIntStubs.c:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclPlatStubs.c:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclStubs.c: Fixed bad eol characters.

	* generic/tclInt.decls: Changed "const" to "CONST" in declarations for
	better portability.

	* generic/tcl.decls: Renamed panic and panicVA to Tcl_Panic and
	Tcl_PanicVA in the stub files.

	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_MakeSafe): Remove tcl_platform(user) from
	safe interps.

1999-03-11  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure.in: Include compat files in the stub library in
	addition to the main library. Compat files are now built for dynamic
	use in all cases.

	* generic/tcl.h: Changed magic number so it doesn't match the plus
	patch, at Jan's request.

	* unix/tclConfig.sh.in:
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in:
	* unix/dltest/configure.in:

	library.

1999-03-10  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Changed Tcl_ReleaseType from an enum to macros so
	it can be used in .rc files. Added Tcl_GetString.

	* mac/tclMacNotify.c:
	* generic/tclNotify.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* win/tclWinNotify.c:
	* generic/tcl.h: Renamed Tcl_AlertNotifier to TclpAlertNotifier.

	* generic/tclInt.decls: Added TclWinAddProcess to make it possible for
	expect to use Tcl_WaitForPid(). This patch is from Gordon Chaffee.

	* mac/tclMacPort.h:
	* win/tclWinInit.c:
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* generic/tclAsync.c: Added TclpAsyncMark to fix bug in async handling
	on Windows where async events don't wake up the event loop. This patch
	comes from Gordon Chaffee.

	* generic/tcl.decls: Fixed declarations of reserved slots.

1999-03-10  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptic.com>

	* generic/tclCompile.h: Ensure that the ByteCode struct is binary
	compatible with the version in 8.0.6.

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c: Add Tcl_GetVersion() function to the public C
	API to allow programs to check the version number of the Tcl library
	at runtime. Also added an enum to clarify the release level (alpha,
	beta, final).

1999-03-09  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* Integrated changes from Tcl 8.0 including:
		stubs mechanism
		configure patches from Jan Nijtmans
		rename of panic to Tcl_Panic

1999-03-08  Lee Bernhard  <lfb@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: Removed Dll instance from thread-local storage.

1999-03-08  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tcl.h: Moved Tcl_Mutex, etc. macros above the inclusion of
	tclDecls.h to avoid macro conflicts.

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/regc_color.c:
	* generic/regcomp.c:

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* generic/tclIOCmd.c:
	* generic/tclParse.c:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c:
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: Cleaned up various compiler warnings,
	eliminated UCHAR bugs.

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:
	* generic/tclThreadTest.c:
	* mac/tclMacThrd.c: Changed TclpCondition*() to Tcl_Condition*().

	* INTEGRATED PATCHES FROM 8.0.6:

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/tclConfig.sh.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/tclWinPort.h: Added Tcl stubs implementation. There are now two
	new macros USE_TCL_STUBS and USE_TCL_STUB_PROCS that enable use of
	stubs and disable stub macros respectively. All of the public and
	private function declarations from tcl.h and tclInt.h have moved into
	the *.decls files and the *Stubs.c and *Decls.h files are generated
	using the genStubs.tcl script.

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/ldAix: Enhanced AIX shared library support.

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Removed a bunch of extraneous PASCAL FAR
	attributes from internal functions.

	* win/tclWinReg.c: Changed registry package to use stubs mechanism so
	it no longer depends on the specific version of Tcl.

	* doc/AddErrInfo.3:
	* doc/Eval.3:
	* doc/PkgRequire.3:
	* doc/SetResult.3:
	* doc/StringObj.3:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclPanic.c:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c:
	* generic/tclUtil.c:
	* unix/mkLinks: Added va_list versions of all VARARGS functions so
	they can be invoked from the stub functions.

	* doc/package.n:
	* doc/PkgRequire.3:
	* generic/tclPkg.c: Added Tcl_PkgProvideEx, Tcl_RequireEx,
	Tcl_PresentEx, and Tcl_PkgPresent. Added "package present" command.

	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c:
	* mac/tclMacShLib.exp:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: Changed so TclGetUserHome is defined on all
	platforms, even though it is currently a noop on mac and windows, and
	renamed it to TclpGetUserHome.

	* generic/tclPanic.c:
	* generic/panic.c: Renamed panic to Tcl_Panic.

1999-02-25  Scott Redman  <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Added tclWinConsole.c and tclWinSerial.c

	* win/tclWinConsole.c: New code to properly deal with fileevents and
	nonblocking mode on consoles.

	* win/tclWinSerial.c: New code to properly deal with fileevents and
	nonblocking mode on serial ports.

	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinPort.h: Exported functions to allow creation of pipe
	channels from tclWinChan.c

	* win/tclWinChan.c: Check the type of a channel, including for the
	standard (stdin/stdout/stderr), and use the correct channel type to
	create the channel (file, serial, console, or pipe).

1999-02-11  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* README:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* win/README.binary:
	* win/README:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* mac/README: Updated version numbers to 8.1b2.

1999-02-10  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/auto.tcl: Fixed auto_mkindex so it handles .tbc files. Did
	some general cleanup to handle bad eval statements that didn't use
	"list".

	* unix/mkLinks:
	* doc/SetVar.3:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclVar.c: Restored Tcl_ObjGetVar2 and Tcl_ObjSetVar2 from
	8.0. Renamed Tcl_Get/SetObjVar2 to Tcl_GetVar2Ex and Tcl_SetVar2Ex.

1999-02-10  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	INTEGRATED PATCHES FROM 8.0.5b2:

	* test/winPipe.test: Changed to remove echoArgs.tcl temporary file
	when done.

	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* generic/tclFileName.c (TclGetExtension): Changed behavior so the
	split happens at the last period in the name instead of the first
	period of the last run of periods. So, "foo..o" is split into "foo."
	and ".o" now. [Bug 1126]

	* win/makefile.vc: Added better support for paths with spaces in the
	name. Added .lib and support .dlls to the install-binaries target.
	Added generate of a pkgIndex.tcl script to the install-libraries
	target.

	* win/tclAppInit.c:
	* unix/tclAppInit.c:
	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c: Changed some EXTERN declarations to extern since
	they are not defining exported interfaces. This avoids generating
	useless declspec() attributes and makes the windows makefile simpler.

	* generic/tcl.h: Moved Tcl_AppInit declaration to end and cleared out
	TCL_STORAGE_CLASS so it is not declared with a declspec().

	* tests/interp.test:
	* generic/tclInterp.c (DeleteAlias): Changed to use
	Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken so we handle renames properly. This avoids
	senseless panic. [Bug 736]

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c:
	* win/tclWinSock.c:
	* doc/socket.n: Applied Gordon Chaffee's patch to handle failures
	during asynchronous socket connection operations. This adds a new
	"-error" fconfgure option to socket channels. [Bug 893]

	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c: Applied patch from Viktor Dukhovni to rationalize
	TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG behavior when creating variables.

	* generic/tclVar.c: Fixed bug in namespace tail computation. Fixed bug
	where upvar could resurrect a namespace variable whose namespace had
	been deleted.

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileExprCmd): Eliminated yet another
	bogus optimization in expression compilation.

	* unix/configure.in: Added branch for BSD/OS-4* to shared library case
	statement. [Bug 975]
	Fixed to correctly handle IRIX 6.5 n32 library support. [Bug 1117]

	* win/winDumpExts.c: Patched to be pickier about stripping @'s. [Bug
	920]

	* library/http2.0/http.tcl: Added catch around eof test in CopyDone
	since the user may have already called http::reset. [Bug 1108]

	* unix/configure.in: Changed Linux and IRIX to set SHLIB_LIBS to LIBS
	so shared libraries are linked with the system libraries. [Bug 1018]

	* generic/tclCompile.c (CompileExprWord): Fixed exception stack
	overflow bug caused by missing statement. [Bug 928]

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c:
	* generic/tclBasic.c: Objectified the "open" command. [Bug 1113]

	* generic/tclPosixStr.c (Tcl_ErrnoId, Tcl_ErrnoMsg): When using egcs,
	ENOTSUP and EOPNOTSUPP are the same, so now we handle that case. [Bug
	1137]

	* library/init.tcl: Various small changes requested by Jan Nijtmans.
	- If the variable $tcl_library contains the empty string, this empty
	  string will be put in $auto_path. This is not useful at all, it only
	  slows down later package processing.
	- If the variable tcl_pkgPath is not set, the "unset __dir" fails.
	  Thich makes init.tcl totally unusable. Better put a "catch" around
	  it.
	- In the function tcl_findLibraries, the "string match" function only
	  works correctly if $tcl_patchLevel is in one of the forms "?.?a?",
	  "?.?b?" or "?.?.?". Could a "regexp" be used instead, then it allows
	  anything to be appended to the patchLevel string. And it is more
	  efficient.
	- The tclPkgSetup function assumes that if $type != "load" then the
	  type must be "source". This needn't be true. Some users want to add
	  their own setup types.
	[RFE 1138] [Bug 978]

	* win/tclWinReg.c:
	* doc/registry.n: Added support for HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA and
	HKEY_DYN_DATA keys. [Bug 1109]

	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclPlatformInit): Added code to ensure tcl_pkgPath
	is set to "" when no registry entry is found. [Bug 978]

1999-02-01  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:

	* generic/tclParse.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* generic/tclTimer.c:
	* generic/tcl.h: Made eval interfaces compatible with 8.0 by renaming
	Tcl_EvalObj to Tcl_EvalObjEx, renaming Tcl_Eval2 to Tcl_EvalEx and
	restoring Tcl_EvalObj and Tcl_GlobalEvalObj interfaces so they match
	Tcl 8.0.

1999-01-28  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* Merged Tcl 8.0.5b1 changes.

	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_DStringSetLength): Changed so the buffer
	overallocates in a manner similar to Tcl_DStringAppend. This should
	improve performance for TclUniCharToUtfDString.

1998-12-11    === Tcl 8.1b1 Release ===

1998-12-10  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* Fixed lots of files that used TCL_THREAD instead of TCL_THREADS.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (Tcl_FreeEncoding): Moved most of the code
	into a static FreeEncoding routine that does not grab the
	encodingMutex to avoid deadlocks/races when called from other routines
	that already have the mutex.

1998-12-09  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/msgcat1.0/msgcat.tcl: Fixed bad export list, fixed so all
	locale strings are converted to lower case, including file names.

	* generic/regcomp.c (makescan): Fixed bug in longest match case that
	caused anchored patterns to fail. [Bug 897]

1998-12-08  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/msgcat1.0/msgcat.tcl: changed mc to invoke mcunknown in the
	calling context, changed locale lookups to be case insensitive

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Fixed bug that kept arguments
	containing spaces from being properly quoted.

	* tests/defs: Changed so auto_path is set to only contain the Tcl
	library directory. This keeps the tests from accidentally picking up
	stuff in installed packages.

	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_StringMatch): Changed to match 8.0 behavior
	in corner case where there is no closing bracket.

1998-12-02  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (TclpCreateCommandChannel): Changed reader/writer
	threads to have THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST so they will have a chance to
	run whenever there is something to do.

	* generic/tclIO.c (WriteBytes, WriteChars): Fixed so extraneous
	flushes do not happen in line mode.
	(TranslateOutputEOL): Made translation more efficient in line mode and

	* generic/regc_color.c (subcolor): Added check for error case to avoid
	an out of bounds array reference.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_EncodingObjCmd): Changed to avoid using
	Tcl_DStringResult because it is not binary clean.

	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_ParseCommand): Fixed bug in comment parsing
	where a trailing comment looked like an incomplete command.

1998-12-02  Brent Welch  <welch@SAGE>

	* Merged changes from 8.0.4, especially the new pkg_mkIndex

1998-12-01  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ReadChars): Added a call to UpdateInterest so
	we don't block when there is data sitting in the buffers.

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestevalobjvObjCmd): Updated for EvalObjv change.

	* tests/parse.test: Updated tests for EvalObjv change.

	* generic/tclParse.c (EvalObjv, Tcl_EvalObjv): Changed Tcl_EvalObjv
	interface to remove string and length arguments, preserved original
	interface as EvalObjv for internal use.

	* generic/tcl.h: Changed Tcl_EvalObjv interface to remove string and
	length arguments.

	* doc/Eval.3: Updated documentation for Tcl_EvalObjv to remove string
	and length arguments.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileForeachCmd): Fixed code that
	corrupted the exceptDepth value in the compile environment when
	foreach failed to compile inline. [Bug 884]

	* library/encoding/euc-kr.enc:
	* library/encoding/ksc5601.enc:
	* tools/encoding/ksc5601.txt:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: Added support for Korean EUC.

	* win/tclWinChan.c (TclpGetDefaultStdChannel): added check for a
	failure during Tcl_MakeFileChannel.

1998-11-30  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_WaitForEvent): Fixed hang that occurs when
	trying to close a pipe that is currently being waited on by the
	notifier thread. [Bug 607]

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (GetPermissionsAttribute): Increase size of
	returnString buffer to avoid overflow. [Bug 584]

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c (TclThreadSend): Fixed memory leak due to
	use of TCL_VOLATILE instead of TCL_DYNAMIC.

	* generic/tclThread.c (TclRememberSyncObject): Fixed memory leak
	caused by failure to reuse condition variables.

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_AlertNotifier, Tcl_WaitForEvent,
	(NotifierThreadProc, Tcl_InitNotifier): Fixed race condition caused by
	incorrect use of condition variables when sending messages between
	threads. [Bug 607]

	* generic/tclTestObj.c (TeststringobjCmd): MAX_STRINGS was off by one
	so the strings array was too small.

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c (Tcl_DbCkfree): Moved mutex lock so
	ValidateMemory is done inside the mutex to avoid a race condition when
	validate_memory is enabled. [Bug 880]

1998-11-23  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* regexec.c: more performance tuning from Henry Spencer.

1998-11-17  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tclScan.c: moved "scan" implementation out of tclCmdMZ.c and added
	Unicode support. This required a complete reimplementation of the
	command to avoid using scanf(), which isn't Unicode aware. Two new
	features were added in the process: %n to return the current number of
	characters consumed, and XPG3-style %n$ argument order specifiers
	similar to those provided by the "format" command. [Bug 833]

	* tclAlloc.c: changed so allocated memory is always 8-byte aligned to
	improve memory performance and to ensure that it will work on systems
	that don't like accessing 4-byte aligned values (e.g. Solaris and
	HP-UX). [Bug 834]

1998-11-06  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tclVar.c (TclGetIndexedScalar): Fixed bug 796, var name was getting
	lost before being passed to CallTraces.

1998-10-21  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* added "encoding" command

	* Moved internal regexp declarations from tclInt.h to tclRegexp.h

	* integrated regexp updates from Henry Spencer

1998-10-15  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tclUtf.c: added Unicode character table support

	* tclInt.h: added TclUniCharIsWordChar

	* tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): added "totitle" subcommand, changed
	"wordend" and "wordstart" to properly handle Unicode word characters
	and connector punctuation

1998-10-05  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* auto.tcl, package.tcl: fixed SCCS strings

	* tclIndex: updated index to reflect 8.1 files

	* tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript): changed to avoid modifying the
	input string in place because name lookup operations could have
	arbitrary side effects

	* tclInterp.c: added guard against deleting current interpreter

	* tclMacFile.c, tclUnixFile.c, tclWinFile.c, tclFileName.c: added
	warnings around code that modifies strings in place

	* tclExecute.c: fixed off-by-one copying error, fixed merge bugs

	* tclEvent.c: changed so USE_TCLALLOC is tested for value instead of
	definition

	* tclCompCmds.c: replaced SCCS strings, added warnings around code
	that modifies strings in place

	* interp.test: added test for interp deleting itself

1998-09-30  Scott Stanton  <stanton@GASPODE>

	* makefile.vc: fixed so TCL_LIBRARY is set before running tcltest

	* tclWin32Dll.c: removed TclpFinalize, cleanup of merges
