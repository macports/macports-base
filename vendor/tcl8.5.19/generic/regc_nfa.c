     * reachable by a chain of one or more EMPTY arcs.  Then generate new arcs
     * that eliminate the need for each such chain.
     *
     * We could replace a chain of EMPTY arcs that leads from a "from" state
     * to a "to" state either by pushing non-EMPTY arcs forward (linking
     * directly from "from"'s predecessors to "to") or by pulling them back
     * (linking directly from "from" to "to"'s successors).  We choose to
     * always do the former; this choice is somewhat arbitrary, but the
     * approach below requires that we uniformly do one or the other.
     *
     * Suppose we have a chain of N successive EMPTY arcs (where N can easily
     * approach the size of the NFA).  All of the intermediate states must
     * have additional inarcs and outarcs, else they'd have been removed by
     * the steps above.  Assuming their inarcs are mostly not empties, we will
     * add O(N^2) arcs to the NFA, since a non-EMPTY inarc leading to any one
     * state in the chain must be duplicated to lead to all its successor
     * states as well.  So there is no hope of doing less than O(N^2) work;
     * however, we should endeavor to keep the big-O cost from being even
     * worse than that, which it can easily become without care.  In
     * particular, suppose we were to copy all S1's inarcs forward to S2, and
     * then also to S3, and then later we consider pushing S2's inarcs forward
     * to S3.  If we include the arcs already copied from S1 in that, we'd be
     * doing O(N^3) work.  (The duplicate-arc elimination built into newarc()
     * and its cohorts would get rid of the extra arcs, but not without cost.)
     *
     * We can avoid this cost by treating only arcs that existed at the start
     * of this phase as candidates to be pushed forward.  To identify those,
     * we remember the first inarc each state had to start with.  We rely on
     * the fact that newarc() and friends put new arcs on the front of their
     * to-states' inchains, and that this phase never deletes arcs, so that
     * the original arcs must be the last arcs in their to-states' inchains.
     *
     * So the process here is that, for each state in the NFA, we gather up
     * all non-EMPTY inarcs of states that can reach the target state via
     * EMPTY arcs.  We then sort, de-duplicate, and merge these arcs into the
     * target state's inchain.  (We can safely use sort-merge for this as long
     * as we update each state's original-arcs pointer after we add arcs to
     * it; the sort step of mergeins probably changed the order of the old
     * arcs.)
     *
     * Another refinement worth making is that, because we only add non-EMPTY
     * arcs during this phase, and all added arcs have the same from-state as
     * the non-EMPTY arc they were cloned from, we know ahead of time that any
     * states having only EMPTY outarcs will be useless for lack of outarcs
     * after we drop the EMPTY arcs.  (They cannot gain non-EMPTY outarcs if
     * they had none to start with.)  So we need not bother to update the
     * inchains of such states at all.

 *
 * sinitial is any one member state of the loop.  Each loop member's tmp
 * field links to its successor within the loop.  (Note that this function
 * will reset all the tmp fields to NULL.)
 *
 * We can break the loop by, for any one state S1 in the loop, cloning its
 * loop successor state S2 (and possibly following states), and then moving
 * all S1->S2 constraint arcs to point to the cloned S2.  The cloned S2 should
 * copy any non-constraint outarcs of S2.  Constraint outarcs should be
 * dropped if they point back to S1, else they need to be copied as arcs to
 * similarly cloned states S3, S4, etc.  In general, each cloned state copies
 * non-constraint outarcs, drops constraint outarcs that would lead to itself
 * or any earlier cloned state, and sends other constraint outarcs to newly
 * cloned states.  No cloned state will have any inarcs that aren't constraint
 * arcs or do not lead from S1 or earlier-cloned states.  It's okay to drop
 * constraint back-arcs since they would not take us to any state we've not
 * already been in; therefore, no new constraint loop is created.  In this way
 * we generate a modified NFA that can still represent every useful state
 * sequence, but not sequences that represent state loops with no consumption
 * of input data.  Note that the set of cloned states will certainly include
 * all of the loop member states other than S1, and it may also include
 * non-loop states that are reachable from S2 via constraint arcs.  This is
 * important because there is no guarantee that findconstraintloop found a
 * maximal loop (and searching for one would be NP-hard, so don't try).
 * Frequently the "non-loop states" are actually part of a larger loop that
 * we didn't notice, and indeed there may be several overlapping loops.
 * This technique ensures convergence in such cases, while considering only
 * the originally-found loop does not.
 *
 * If there is only one S1->S2 constraint arc, then that constraint is
 * certainly satisfied when we enter any of the clone states.  This means that
 * in the common case where many of the constraint arcs are identically
 * labeled, we can merge together clone states linked by a similarly-labeled
 * constraint: if we can get to the first one we can certainly get to the
 * second, so there's no need to distinguish.  This greatly reduces the number
 * of new states needed, so we preferentially break the given loop at a state
 * pair where this is true.
 *
 * Furthermore, it's fairly common to find that a cloned successor state has
 * no outarcs, especially if we're a bit aggressive about removing unnecessary
 * outarcs.  If that happens, then there is simply not any interesting state
 * that can be reached through the predecessor's loop arcs, which means we can
 * break the loop just by removing those loop arcs, with no new states added.
