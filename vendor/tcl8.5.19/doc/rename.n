.SH NAME
rename \- Rename or delete a command
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrename \fIoldName newName\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Rename the command that used to be called \fIoldName\fR so that it
is now called \fInewName\fR.
If \fInewName\fR is an empty string then \fIoldName\fR is deleted.
\fIoldName\fR and \fInewName\fR may include namespace qualifiers
(names of containing namespaces).
If a command is renamed into a different namespace,
future invocations of it will execute in the new namespace.
The \fBrename\fR command returns an empty string as result.
.SH EXAMPLE
The \fBrename\fR command can be used to wrap the standard Tcl commands
with your own monitoring machinery.  For example, you might wish to
count how often the \fBsource\fR command is called:
.CS
\fBrename\fR ::source ::theRealSource
set sourceCount 0
proc ::source args {
    global sourceCount
    puts "called source for the [incr sourceCount]'th time"
    uplevel 1 ::theRealSource $args
}
.CE

.SH "SEE ALSO"
