.SH NAME
lreplace \- Replace elements in a list with new elements
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlreplace \fIlist first last \fR?\fIelement element ...\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBlreplace\fR returns a new list formed by replacing one or more elements of
\fIlist\fR with the \fIelement\fR arguments.
.VS 8.5
\fIfirst\fR and \fIlast\fR are index values specifying the first and
last elements of the range to replace.
The index values \fIfirst\fR and \fIlast\fR are interpreted
the same as index values for the command \fBstring index\fR,
supporting simple index arithmetic and indices relative to the
end of the list.
0 refers to the first element of the
list, and \fBend\fR refers to the last element of the list.
If \fIlist\fR is empty, then \fIfirst\fR and \fIlast\fR are ignored.
.VE
.PP
If \fIfirst\fR is less than zero, it is considered to refer to before the
first element of the list.  For non-empty lists, the element indicated
by \fIfirst\fR must exist or \fIfirst\fR must indicate before the
start of the list.
.PP
If \fIlast\fR is less than \fIfirst\fR, then any specified elements
will be inserted into the list at the point specified by \fIfirst\fR
with no elements being deleted.
.PP
The \fIelement\fR arguments specify zero or more new arguments to
be added to the list in place of those that were deleted.
Each \fIelement\fR argument will become a separate element of
the list.  If no \fIelement\fR arguments are specified, then the elements
between \fIfirst\fR and \fIlast\fR are simply deleted.  If \fIlist\fR
is empty, any \fIelement\fR arguments are added to the end of the list.
.SH EXAMPLES
Replacing an element of a list with another:
.CS
% \fBlreplace\fR {a b c d e} 1 1 foo
a foo c d e
.CE
.PP
Replacing two elements of a list with three:
.CS
% \fBlreplace\fR {a b c d e} 1 2 three more elements
a three more elements d e
.CE
.PP
Deleting the last element from a list in a variable:
.CS
% set var {a b c d e}
a b c d e
% set var [\fBlreplace\fR $var end end]
a b c d
.CE
.PP
A procedure to delete a given element from a list:
.CS
proc lremove {listVariable value} {
    upvar 1 $listVariable var
    set idx [lsearch -exact $var $value]
    set var [\fBlreplace\fR $var $idx $idx]
}
