# This shell script provides a wrapper for ld under AIX in order to
# create the .exp file required for linking.  Its arguments consist
# of the name and arguments that would normally be provided to the
# ld command.  This script extracts the names of the object files
# from the argument list, creates a .exp file describing all of the
# symbols exported by those files, and then invokes "ldCmd" to
# perform the real link.

# Extract from the arguments the names of all of the object files.

# Create the export file from all of the object files, using nm followed
# by sed editing.  Here are some tricky aspects of this:
#
# - Use the -X32_64 switch to nm to handle 32 or 64bit compiles.
# - Eliminate lines that end in ":": these are the names of object files
# - Eliminate entries with the "U" key letter;  these are undefined symbols
# - If a line starts with ".", delete the leading ".", since this will just
#   cause confusion later
# - Eliminate everything after the first field in a line, so that we're
#   left with just the symbol name
