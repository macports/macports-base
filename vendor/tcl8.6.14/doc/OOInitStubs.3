.SH NAME
Tcl_OOInitStubs \- initialize library access to TclOO functionality
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tclOO.h>\fR
.sp
const char *
\fBTcl_OOInitStubs\fR(\fIinterp\fR)
.fi
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp in
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
The Tcl interpreter that the TclOO API is integrated with and whose C
interface is going to be used.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
When an extension library is going to use the C interface exposed by TclOO, it
should use \fBTcl_OOInitStubs\fR to initialize its access to that interface
from within its \fI*\fB_Init\fR (or \fI*\fB_SafeInit\fR) function, passing in
the \fIinterp\fR that was passed into that routine as context. If the result
of calling \fBTcl_OOInitStubs\fR is NULL, the initialization failed and an
error message will have been left in the interpreter's result. Otherwise, the
initialization succeeded and the TclOO API may thereafter be used; the
version of the TclOO API is returned.
.PP
When using this function, either the C #define symbol \fBUSE_TCLOO_STUBS\fR
should be defined and your library code linked against the Tcl stub library,
or that #define symbol should \fInot\fR be defined and your library code
linked against the Tcl main library directly.
.SH "BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY NOTE"
.PP
If you are linking against the Tcl 8.5 forward compatibility package for
TclOO, \fIonly\fR the stub-enabled configuration is supported and you should
also link against the TclOO independent stub library; that library is an
integrated part of the main Tcl stub library in Tcl 8.6.
