.TH Load 3 8.6 Tcl "Tcl Library Procedures"
.so man.macros
.BS
.SH NAME
Tcl_LoadFile, Tcl_FindSymbol \- platform-independent dynamic library loading
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_LoadFile\fR(\fIinterp, pathPtr, symbols, flags, procPtrs, loadHandlePtr\fR)
.sp
void *
\fBTcl_FindSymbol\fR(\fIinterp, loadHandle, symbol\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_LoadHandle loadHandle in
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter to use for reporting error messages.
.AP Tcl_Obj *pathPtr in
The name of the file to load. If it is a single name, the library search path
of the current environment will be used to resolve it.
.AP "const char *const" symbols[] in
Array of names of symbols to be resolved during the load of the library, or
NULL if no symbols are to be resolved. If an array is given, the last entry in
the array must be NULL.
.AP int flags in
The value should normally be 0, but \fITCL_LOAD_GLOBAL\fR or \fITCL_LOAD_LAZY\fR
or a combination of those two is allowed as well.
.AP void *procPtrs out
Points to an array that will hold the addresses of the functions described in
the \fIsymbols\fR argument. Should be NULL if no symbols are to be resolved.
.AP Tcl_LoadHandle *loadHandlePtr out
Points to a variable that will hold the handle to the abstract token
describing the library that has been loaded.
.AP Tcl_LoadHandle loadHandle in
Abstract token describing the library to look up a symbol in.
.AP "const char" *symbol in
The name of the symbol to look up.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_LoadFile\fR loads a file from the filesystem (including potentially any
virtual filesystem that has been installed) and provides a handle to it that
may be used in further operations. The \fIsymbols\fR array, if non-NULL,
supplies a set of names of symbols (typically functions) that must be resolved
from the library and which will be stored in the array indicated by
\fIprocPtrs\fR. If any of the symbols is not resolved, the loading of the file
will fail with an error message left in the interpreter (if that is non-NULL).
The result of \fBTcl_LoadFile\fR is a standard Tcl error code. The library may
be unloaded with \fBTcl_FSUnloadFile\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_FindSymbol\fR locates a symbol in a loaded library and returns it. If
the symbol cannot be found, it returns NULL and sets an error message in the
given \fIinterp\fR (if that is non-NULL). Note that it is unsafe to use this
operation on a handle that has been passed to \fBTcl_FSUnloadFile\fR.
