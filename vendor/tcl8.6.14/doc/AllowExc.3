Interpreter in which script will be evaluated.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
If a script is evaluated at top-level (i.e. no other scripts are
pending evaluation when the script is invoked), and if the script
terminates with a completion code other than \fBTCL_OK\fR, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR
or \fBTCL_RETURN\fR, then Tcl normally converts this into a \fBTCL_ERROR\fR
return with an appropriate message.  The particular script
evaluation procedures of Tcl that act in the manner are
\fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR, \fBTcl_EvalObjv\fR, \fBTcl_Eval\fR, \fBTcl_EvalEx\fR,
\fBTcl_GlobalEval\fR, \fBTcl_GlobalEvalObj\fR, \fBTcl_VarEval\fR and
\fBTcl_VarEvalVA\fR.
.PP
However, if \fBTcl_AllowExceptions\fR is invoked immediately before
calling one of those a procedures, then arbitrary completion
codes are permitted from the script, and they are returned without
modification.
This is useful in cases where the caller can deal with exceptions
such as \fBTCL_BREAK\fR or \fBTCL_CONTINUE\fR in a meaningful way.
