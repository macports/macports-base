.SH NAME
lappend \- Append list elements onto a variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlappend \fIvarName \fR?\fIvalue value value ...\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command treats the variable given by \fIvarName\fR as a list
and appends each of the \fIvalue\fR arguments to that list as a separate
element, with spaces between elements.
If \fIvarName\fR does not exist, it is created as a list with elements
given by the \fIvalue\fR arguments.
\fBLappend\fR is similar to \fBappend\fR except that the \fIvalue\fRs
are appended as list elements rather than raw text.
This command provides a relatively efficient way to build up
large lists.  For example,
.QW "\fBlappend a $b\fR"
is much more efficient than
.QW "\fBset a [concat $a [list $b]]\fR"
when \fB$a\fR is long.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Using \fBlappend\fR to build up a list of numbers.
