			       the environment variable TDBCMYSQL_TEST_DB
			       explicitly designates a database.

2012-07-10  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Fixed a non-static table argument to
			       Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct.

2011-02-20  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/tdbcmysql.test:
		Added rudimentary test for 'nextresults' - the method
		is a dummy because the calls supported by tdbc::mysql
		do not allow for multiple result sets.

2011-01-26  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/tdbc_mysql.n:
	Added empty comment at the start of each manpage because 'man'
	interprets comments there as directives. Thanks to Konstantin
	Kohmoutov for reporting and diagnosing this error.

2011-01-25  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Fixed a bug in data types of small integers
			       on 64-bit machines. Who would have imagined
			       that MSYQL_TYPE_LONG doesn't mean 'long' but
			       rather 'int'?
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test (tdbc::mysql-1.6,24.[4567]):
		Quieted test cases on 64-bit machines and on MySQL earlier
		than 5.1.16, which is the first version on which
		'foreignkeys' functions correctly.
	Thanks to Damon Courtney for reporting these bugs.

2010-12-28  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/fakemysql.h: Added the MYSQL data structure and the
			       nest of other definitions that it depends on.
	* generic/mysqlStubDefs.txt: Added mysql_affected_rows and
				     mysql_field_count.
	* generic/mysqlStubInit.c, generic/mysqlStubs.h: Regenerated.
	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Added 'evaldirect' method that allows
			       executing statements that are unimplemented
			       in the MySQL prepared statement API.
	* generic/tdbcmysql.tcl: Did a rough (not really functional) hack
	                         at formatting prepared statements.
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test (tdbc::mysql-25.*): Added two tests for
	creating a (parameterless) stored procedure and executing it.

2010-09-03  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Added missing TCLOO_CFLAGS because Windows build
			failed to link without it.
	* configure: autoconf 2-59

	* generic/mysqlStubInit.c:
			Made changes to attempt to open the
			MySQL client library by SONAME as well as
			pathname, in an effort to fit in better
			with systems where libmysqlclient-devel
			is not installed.

	* library/tdbcmysql.tcl:
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test:
			Changed 'keySequence' to 'ordinalPosition' in
			'foreignkeys' for consistency with 'primarykeys'.

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	* pkgIndex.tcl.in (new file):
	* README:
	* tclconfig/:	Upgraded the build to use TEA 3.9. Changed the
			approach to pkgIndex.tcl generation. (It's now built
			at configure time, rather than from the Makefile.)
			Advanced version number to 1.0b16.

	* configure: 	autoconf 2.59

2010-06-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in:			Revised the code at the suggestion
	* generic/tdbcmysql.c:		of Andreas Kupries to avoid using
	* tests/all.tcl:		'tcl_findLibrary' and instead execute
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test:		both 'source' and 'load' commands from
					'pkgIndex.tcl'. Revised the 'make test'
					rule, and the test scripts, to
					test successfully under the new regime.
					Thanks to Andreas for providing the
					original patch, and to Joe English
					for providing ideas for simplifying
					and repairing 'make test' under the
					new regime.

2010-05-23  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/tdbcmysql.tcl: Added a 'BuildForeignKeysStatement' method
	                         to tdbcmysql::connection that overrides the
				 one in the base class and accommodates the
				 nonstandard INFORMATION_SCHEMA provided in
				 MySQL.
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test: Added test cases for '$db primarykeys'
	                        and '$db foreignkeys'

2010-05-12  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/fakesql.h:
			Added dual definitions of data structures that change
			between MySQL 5.0 and 5.1.
	* generic/mysqlStubDefs.h:
			Added code to link to mysqlclient_r and mysqlclient
			as well as mysql so that client libs can be found
			on Unix. Added query of the client lib version.
	* generic/mysqlStubInit.c:
			Regenerate
	* generic/mysqlStubs.h:
			Regenerate
	* generic/tdbcmysql.c:
			Modified to make MYSQL_BIND and MYSQL_FIELD accesses
			go through accessor functions that hit the correct
			versions of the structures according to the client
			library version. (Tcl can provide ABI stability,
			even if MySQL can't!)
	* configure.in: Advance release to 1.0b15.1
	* README:	Advance release to 1.0b15.1
	* configure:	autoconf-2.59

2010-05-10  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

			Corrected the TDBC stub library specification so that
			it works under MSVC.
	* generic/mysqlStubDefs.txt:
			Split out the linkage convention so that
			genExtStubs.tcl can generate syntactically correct
			VC++ pointer-to-function declarations.
	* generic/mysqlStubInit.c:
	* generic/mysqlStubs.h:
			Regenerate
	* generic/tdbcmysql.c:
			Added code to silence VC++ warnings.

	* configure.in: Disabled TEA_*_TKCONFIG. Code doesn't depend on Tk.
	* configure: Regenerated.

2010-04-30  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in: Added explicit reference to the TDBC library in the
		       TCLSH_ENV. Updated the 'dist' rule to include new files.
		       Added a 'genstubs' rule to make the stubs to load
	               the MySQL libraries at run time.
	* configure.in: Removed compile-time references to the MySQL headers
	                and libraries. Added new files to SOURCES and HEADERS.
	* generic/fakemysql.h (new file):
		Minimal subset of mysql.h needed to make tdbc::mysql compile.
	* generic/mysqlStubDefs.txt (new file):
		Definitions of MySQL runtime library routines brought
		in by dynamic loading.
	* generic/mysqlStubInit.c (new file):
		Code to load the MySQL runtime library and build a stub
		table for it.
	* generic/mysqlStubDefs.txt (new file):
		Definitions of the routines to be resolved when loading
		the MySQL library at run time.
	* generic/tdbcmysql.c:
		Changed tdbc::mysql to load the MySQL library at run time
		and to have no compile-time dependencies on MySQL.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbc::mysql-14.8):
		Corrected a misnamed test.

2010-04-25  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:	for better TEA compatibility. Advanced version number
			to 1.0b14.
	* configure:	autoconf-2.59

2009-09-29  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/tdbcmysql.test: Changed all TEST_* environment variables
				to TDBCMYSQL_* for easier high-level scripting
				of the tests.

	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

2009-04-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Silenced a compiler warning about 'fields'
	                       being used uninitialized.
	* doc/tdbc_mysql.n: Added missing documentation for 'new' constructors.

2009-04-18  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Changed so that an inappropriate access to
	                       an array or a failing read trace yields NULL.
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test: Revised test cases according to the above
				change.
	* doc/tdbc_mysql.n: Made changes so that NROFF formatting matches
	                    the Tcl standard.

2009-04-16  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:
	* configure.in:		Advance version number to 1.0b10
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Reworked the allocation of result buffers
			       so that they belong to the result set and
			       are not allocated per row. Pushed binding the
	                       results up before mysql_stmt_execute,
	                       avoiding a crash if the same statement handle
	                       has been used before [Ticket 39a78606aa].
			       No update made to test suite because
			       valgrind detected the error with existing
			       tests on a -DPURIFY build.

2009-03-03  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcmysql.c:
	* library/tdbcmysql.tcl: Replaced 'init' methods with constructors
	written in C.  Added 'statementCreate' and 'resultSetCreate' forwarding
	in place of the 'statementClass' and 'resultSetClass' variables.
	Removed some classes that were the result of overeager copying
	from tclodbc. Replaced 'my variable' with variables declared at
	class level.

2009-02-14  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/tdbc_mysql.n:	Many small format changes to make 'man2html'
				work.

	more [try]-friendly. Changed include to <mysql/mysql.h> so that
	the include path isn't necessary.
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test: Added test flags so that a nonstandard port
	or socket can be specified. Changed errorCode-dependent tests to
	look for the new form of errorCode.

2009-01-05  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README: Added a few more hints for building on Windows.

	of the 'tdbcodbc' package. Added installation and distribution code.
	* configure.in: Advanced version to 1.0b5
	* generic/tdbcmysql.c: Added code to track the declared data types
	of parameters and the actual data types of results. Added code to
	do direct binary conversions of integers, floating point numbers,
	and bit strings. Added checks for binary data on results.
	Added disambiguation of duplicated colmn names.
	* tests/tdbcmysql.test: Revised test cases to include all the
	MySQL data types handled in this driver. Added a test case that
