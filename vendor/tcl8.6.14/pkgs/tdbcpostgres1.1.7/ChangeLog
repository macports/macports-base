	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c: Corrected a problem where PostgreSQL 9.0
	                          and beyond return byte arrays in an
				  incompatible format, yielding silent
				  data corruption in SELECT operations.
	                          (Bug [4357c31d89])

2012-07-10  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

			          Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct.

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	* README:	Advanced version number to 1.0b17.

	* configure:    autoconf-2.59

2011-04-12  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennybk@acm.org>

	* generic/pqStubDefs.txt:
		Added stubs for PQdescribePrepared, PQnparams and PQparamtype,
		needed for correct parameter specification of prepared
		statements.
	* generic/pqStubInit.c:
	* generic/pgStubs.h:
		make genstubs
	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c (PrepareStatement, StatementConstructor):
		Changed statement preparation to *not* specify unknown
		data types but to let the PostgreSQL server try to deduce
		them all. Added code to report the deduced parameter types
		back to the script in the 'params' method. Added code to
		the statement constructor to accept PostgreSQL type cast
		syntax as a way to make prepared statements work when they
		otherwise would give 'could not determine data type' errors.
	* tests/tdbcpostgres.test (tdbc::postgres-18.[45]):
		Added test cases for correct reporting of deduced parameter
		types and for PostgreSQL

2011-02-20  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/pqStubInit.c:
		Revised code to look for libpq.so by SONAME as well
		as directly, so that ABI version number is taken into
		account and so that libpq-dev is not required.
	* generic/pqStubs.h: make genstubs

2011-01-26  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/tdbc_postgres.n:
	Added empty comment at the start of each manpage because 'man'
	interprets comments there as directives. Thanks to Konstantin
	Kohmoutov for reporting and diagnosing this error.

2011-01-23  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c: Modified to pass '@' through into the
				  native SQL to allow session variables.
				  Fixed a pointer smash if the argument
				  to "$connection prepare" includes no
				  SQL statement (e.g. contains only whitespace)
	* library/tdbcpostgres.tcl: Added 'nextresults' method, which always
				    returns 0 since PostgreSQL calls return
				    single result sets.
	* tests/tdbcpostgres.test: Added test cases (30.0 and 30.1) for the
	                           above.
	* configure.in: Added a missing stanza of code for finding the tdbc
	                library and include in the build dir when building
	                against an uninstalled tdbc. Thanks to Konstantin
	                Khomoutov for reporting this error.
	* configure: autoconf2.59

2010-09-03  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c:
			Made the '-port' option work. (Discovered bug when
			testing on a machine where Postgres was listening
			on 5433 but the client lib wanted 5432.)

	* tests/tdbcpostgres.test:
			Changed 'keySequence' in 'foreignkeys' to be
			'ordinalPosition' for consistency with 'primaryKeys'.

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	* pkgIndex.tcl.in (new file):
	* README:
	* tclconfig/:	Upgraded the build to use TEA 3.9. Changed the
			approach to pkgIndex.tcl generation. (It's now built
			at configure time, rather than from the Makefile.)
			Advanced version number to 1.0b16.

	* configure: 	autoconf 2.59

2010-06-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in:			Revised the code at the suggestion
	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c:	of Andreas Kupries to avoid using
	* tests/all.tcl:		'tcl_findLibrary' and instead execute
	* tests/tdbcpostgres.test:	both 'source' and 'load' commands from
					'pkgIndex.tcl'. Revised the 'make test'
					rule, and the test scripts, to
					test successfully under the new regime.
					Thanks to Andreas for providing the
					original patch, and to Joe English
					for providing ideas for simplifying
					and repairing 'make test' under the
					new regime.

2010-05-24  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennybk@acm.org>

	* tests/tdbcpostgres.test: Added test cases for '$db primarykeys'
				   and '$db foreignkeys'

2010-05-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c: Moved the int32_t/int16_t types into the
	  _WIN32 conditional. Conflicted with HPUX own definitions of
	  these types and required only for windows.

2010-05-10  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* aclocal.m4:	Synchronized with tdbc.
	* configure.in:	Advanced version number to 1.0b15. Advanced TEA
			version to 3.7. Corrected the way that stub libraries
			are located on VC++.
	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c:
			Corrected a number of errors and warnings in the
			VC++ build.
	* README:	Advanced to 1.0b15
	* tclconfig/:	Advanced to TEA 3.7
	* configure:	autoconf-2.59

2010-05-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c: Fixed violations of strict C89.
	* Makefile.in: Removed attempt to generate a stub library. Drivers
	  do not export stub tables.

2010-05-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/fakehq.h: Fixed inclusion of pqstubs.h -> pqStubs.h.

2010-05-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	* generic/fakepq.h (new file):
	* generic/pqStubDefs.txt (new file):
	* generic/pqStubInit.c (new file):
	* generic/pqStubs.h (new file):
	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c:
		Modified to load libpq using Tcl_LoadFile and not
		link to its client library, nor include the standard
		pq-fe headers. This change allows tdbc::postgres to
		build when the build system lacks a PostgreSQL installation.

2010-04-25  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Changed TDBC_* environment variables to tdbc_* for
	* README:       better TEA compatibility. Advanced version to 1.0b14.
	* configure:    autoconf 2.59

2009-09-29  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/tdbcpostgres.test: Changed all TEST_* environment variables
				   to TDBCPOSTGRES_* for easier scripting
			 	   of combined builds and tests.

2009-09-23  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c: Removed an ugly workaround for a
	                          bug in Tcl_SubstObj.
	* configure.in:
	* README:		Advanced version to 1.0b13
	* configure:		autoconf 2.59

2009-09-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure (New file): autoconf 2.59
		(Added pre-built 'configure' so that TEA users don't
		need autoconf, m4 and all that stuff pre-installed)
	* generic/tdbcpostgres.c:   Many changes to upgrade to Tcl Engineering
	* library/tdbcpostgres.tcl: Manual conventions and correct memory
	* tests/current.test:       mismanagement. Introduced a workaround
			            for a suspected bug in Tcl_SubstObj.

2009-09-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	Accepted tdbcpostgres from Slawomir Cygan for inclusion in
	the standard tdbc driver distribution.

2009-06-22  Slawomir Cygan  <slawomir.cygan@gmail.com>
	Initial baseline of a TDBC driver for Postgres.
