Software here is provided as example of making some interesting
things and applications using the Tcl threading extension.

Currently, following packages are supplied:

   tpool/    Example Tcl-only implementation of thread pools.
             The threading extension includes an efficient
             threadpool implementation in C. This file is
             provided as a fully functional example on how this
             functionality could be implemented in Tcl alone.

   phttpd/   MT-enabled httpd server. It uses threadpool to
             distribute incoming requests among several worker
             threads in the threadpool. This way blocking
             requests may be handled much better, w/o halting
             the event loop of the main responder thread.
             In this directory you will also find the uhttpd.
             This is the same web-server but operating in the
             event-loop mode alone, no threadpool support.
             This is good for comparison purposes.

   cmdsrv/   Socket command-line server. Each new connection
             gets new thread, thus allowing multiple outstanding
             blocking calls without halting the event loop.

To play around with above packages, change to the corresponding
directory and source files in the Tcl8.4 (or later) Tcl shell.
Be sure to have the latest Tcl threading extension installed in
your package path.
