# As of 2.6, the threading extension supports persistent
# shared variables. As an working example of this, there
# is a simple wrapper for the popular Gdbm library.
# Uncomment the following line if you like to compile the
# Gdbm wrapper for persistent shared variables.
#
# ../configure --enable-threads --with-gdbm
#
# If your Gdbm library is not installed in one of the
# default system locations (/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib ...)
# please use following directive. Note that both library
# file *and* includes should be located in "/my/gdbm".
# Of course, you have to replace the "/my/gdbm" below
# with the exact location, as found in your system:
#
# ../configure --enable-threads --with-gdbm=/my/gdbm

# AOLserver 4.X; Uses public Tcl library.

# nsdir="/usr/local/naviserver"
# ../configure --enable-threads \

#
# NaviServer/AOLserver uses its own package loading mechanism.
# To load, just do "ns_eval package require Thread"
# at the NaviServer/AOLserver startup or later from any thread.
