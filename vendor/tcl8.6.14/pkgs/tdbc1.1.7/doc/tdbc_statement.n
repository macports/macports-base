.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Every database driver for TDBC (Tcl DataBase Connectivity) implements
a \fIstatement\fR object that represents a SQL statement in a
database. Instances of this object are created by executing the
\fBprepare\fR or \fBpreparecall\fR object command on a database
connection.
.PP
The \fBprepare\fR object command against the connection
accepts arbitrary SQL code to be
executed against the database. The SQL code may contain \fIbound
variables\fR, which are strings of alphanumeric characters or
underscores (the first character of the string may not be numeric),
prefixed with a colon (\fB:\fR). If a bound variable appears in the
SQL statement, and is not in a string set off by single or double
quotes, nor in a comment introduced by \fB--\fR, it becomes a value
that is substituted when the statement is executed. A bound variable
becomes a single value (string or numeric) in the resulting
statement. \fIDrivers are responsible for ensuring that the mechanism
for binding variables prevents SQL injection.\fR
.PP
The \fBpreparecall\fR object command against the connection accepts a
stylized statement in the form:
.PP
.CS
\fIprocname\fR \fB(\fR?\fB:\fR\fIvarname\fR? ?\fB,:\fR\fIvarname\fR...?\fB)\fR
.CE
.PP
or
.PP
.CS
\fIvarname\fR \fB=\fR \fIprocname\fR \fB(\fR?\fB:\fR\fIvarname\fR? ?\fB,:\fR\fIvarname\fR...?\fB)\fR
.CE
.PP
This statement represents a call to a stored procedure \fIprocname\fR in the
database. The variable name to the left of the equal sign (if
present), and all variable names that are parameters inside
parentheses, become bound variables.
.PP
The \fBparams\fR method against a statement object enumerates the
bound variables that appear in the statement. The result returned from
the \fBparams\fR method is a dictionary whose keys are the names of
bound variables (listed in the order in which the variables first
appear in the statement), and whose values are dictionaries. The
subdictionaries include at least the following keys (database drivers
may add additional keys that are not in this list).
.IP \fBdirection\fR
Contains one of the keywords, \fBin\fR, \fBout\fR or \fBinout\fR
according to whether the variable is an input to or output from the
statement. Only stored procedure calls will have \fBout\fR or
\fBinout\fR parameters.
.IP \fBtype\fR
Contains the data type of the column, and will generally be chosen
from the set,
\fBbigint\fR, \fBbinary\fR, \fBbit\fR, \fBchar\fR, \fBdate\fR,
\fBdecimal\fR, \fBdouble\fR, \fBfloat\fR, \fBinteger\fR,
\fBlongvarbinary\fR, \fBlongvarchar\fR, \fBnumeric\fR, \fBreal\fR,
\fBtime\fR, \fBtimestamp\fR, \fBsmallint\fR, \fBtinyint\fR,
\fBvarbinary\fR, and \fBvarchar\fR. (If the variable has a type that
cannot be represented as one of the above, \fBtype\fR will contain
a driver-dependent description of the type.)
.IP \fBprecision\fR
Contains the precision of the column in bits, decimal digits, or the
width in characters, according to the type.
.IP \fBscale\fR
Contains the scale of the column (the number of digits after the radix
point), for types that support the concept.
.IP \fBnullable\fR
Contains 1 if the column can contain NULL values, and 0 otherwise.
.PP
The \fBparamtype\fR object command allows the script to specify the
type and direction of parameter transmission of a variable in a
statement. (Some databases provide no method to determine this
information automatically and place the burden on the caller to do
so.) The \fIdirection\fR, \fItype\fR, \fIprecision\fR, \fIscale\fR,
and \fInullable\fR arguments have the same meaning as the
corresponding dictionary values in the \fBparams\fR object command.
.PP
The \fBexecute\fR object command executes the statement. Prior to
executing the statement, values are provided for the bound variables
that appear in it.  If the \fIdict\fR parameter is supplied, it is
searched for a key whose name matches the name of the bound
variable. If the key is present, its value becomes the substituted
variable. If not, the value of the substituted variable becomes a SQL
NULL. If the \fIdict\fR parameter is \fInot\fR supplied, the
\fBexecute\fR object command searches for a variable in the caller's
scope whose name matches the name of the bound variable. If one is
found, its value becomes the bound variable's value. If none is found,
the bound variable is assigned a SQL NULL as its value.  Once
substitution is finished, the resulting statement is executed. The
return value is a result set object (see \fBtdbc::resultset\fR for
details).
.PP
The \fBresultsets\fR method returns a list of all the result sets that
have been returned by executing the statement and have not yet been
closed.
.PP
The \fBallrows\fR object command executes the statement as with the
\fBexecute\fR object command, accepting an
optional \fIdict\fR parameter giving bind variables. After executing
the statement,
it uses the \fIallrows\fR object command on the result set (see
\fBtdbc::resultset\fR) to construct a list of the results. Finally,
the result set is closed. The return value is the list of
results.
.PP
The \fBforeach\fR object command executes the statement as with the
\fBexecute\fR object command, accepting an
optional \fIdict\fR parameter giving bind variables. After executing
the statement,
it uses the \fIforeach\fR object command on the result set (see
\fBtdbc::resultset\fR) to evaluate the given \fIscript\fR for each row of
the results. Finally, the result set is closed, even
if the given \fIscript\fR results in a \fBreturn\fR, an error, or
an unusual return code.
.PP
The \fBclose\fR object command removes a statement and any result sets
that it has created. All system resources associated with the objects
are freed.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The following code would look up a telephone number in a directory,
assuming an appropriate SQL schema:
.PP
.CS
package require tdbc::sqlite3
tdbc::sqlite3::connection create db phonebook.sqlite3
set statement [db prepare {
    select phone_num from directory
    where first_name = :firstname and last_name = :lastname
}]
set firstname Fred
set lastname Flintstone
$statement foreach row {
    puts [dict get $row phone_num]
}
$statement close
db close
