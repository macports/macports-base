[para]

The [package smtp] library package provides the client side of the
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) (1) (2).

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::smtp::sendmessage] [arg token] [arg option]...]

This command sends the MIME part (see package [package mime])
represented by [arg token] to an SMTP server. [arg options] is a list
of options and their associated values.  The recognized options are:

[list_begin definitions]

[def [option -servers]]

A list of SMTP servers. The default is [const localhost].

[def [option -ports]]

A list of SMTP ports. The default is [const 25].

[def [option -client]]

The name to use as our hostname when connecting to the server. By
default this is either localhost if one of the servers is localhost,
or is set to the string returned by [cmd "info hostname"].

[def [option -queue]]

Indicates that the SMTP server should be asked to queue the message
for later processing. A boolean value.

[def [option -atleastone]]

Indicates that the SMTP server must find at least one recipient
acceptable for the message to be sent. A boolean value.

[def [option -originator]]

A string containing an 822-style address specification. If present the
header isn't examined for an originator address.

[def [option -recipients]]

A string containing one or more 822-style address specifications. If
present the header isn't examined for recipient addresses). If the
string contains more than one address they will be separated by
commas.

[def [option -header]]

A list containing two elements, an smtp header and its associated
value (the -header option may occur zero or more times).

[def [option -usetls]]

This package supports the RFC 3207 TLS extension (3) by default provided the
tls package is available. You can turn this off with this boolean option.

[def [option -tlspolicy]]

This option lets you specify a command to be called if an error occurs
during TLS setup. The command is called with the SMTP code and diagnostic
message appended. The command should return 'secure' or 'insecure' where
insecure will cause the package to continue on the unencrypted channel.
Returning 'secure' will cause the socket to be closed and the next server
in the [option -servers] list to be tried.

[def [option -username]]
[def [option -password]]

If your SMTP server requires authentication (RFC 2554 (4)) before
accepting mail you can use [option -username] and [option -password]
to provide your authentication details to the server. Currently this
package supports DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, LOGIN and PLAIN authentication
methods. The most secure method will be tried first and each method
tried in turn until we are either authorized or we run out of
methods. Note that if the server permits a TLS connection, then the
authorization will occur after we begin using the secure channel.

[para]
Please also read the section on [sectref Authentication], it details
the necessary prequisites, i.e. packages needed to support these
options and authentication.

[list_end]
[para]

If the [option -originator] option is not present, the originator
address is taken from [const From] (or [const Resent-From]);
similarly, if the [option -recipients] option is not present,
recipient addresses are taken from [const To], [const cc], and
[const Bcc] (or [const Resent-To], and so on). Note that the header
key/values supplied by the [option -header] option (not those present
in the MIME part) are consulted. Regardless, header key/values are
added to the outgoing message as necessary to ensure that a valid
822-style message is sent.

[para]

The command returns a list indicating which recipients were
unacceptable to the SMTP server. Each element of the list is another
list, containing the address, an SMTP error code, and a textual
diagnostic. Depending on the [option -atleastone] option and the
intended recipients, a non-empty list may still indicate that the
message was accepted by the server.

[list_end]

[section Authentication]

Beware. SMTP authentication uses [package SASL]. I.e. if the user
has to authenticate a connection, i.e. use the options [option -user]
and [option -password] (see above) it is necessary to have the
[package sasl] package available so that [package smtp] can load it.

[para]

This is a soft dependency because not everybody requires authentication,
and [package sasl] depends on a lot of the cryptographic (secure) hashes,
i.e. all of [package md5], [package otp], [package md4], [package sha1],
and [package ripemd160].

[section EXAMPLE]

[example {
proc send_simple_message {recipient email_server subject body} {
    package require smtp
    package require mime

    set token [mime::initialize -canonical text/plain \\
	-string $body]
    mime::setheader $token Subject $subject
    smtp::sendmessage $token \\
	-recipients $recipient -servers $email_server
    mime::finalize $token
}

send_simple_message someone@somewhere.com localhost \\
    "This is the subject." "This is the message."
}]
