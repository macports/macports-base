[section API]
[subsection Introspection]

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::macros::names]]

This command is for introspection. It returns as its result a list
containing the names of all attribute commands.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::macros::import] [opt [arg ns]] [opt [arg arg]...]]

This command imports some or all attribute commands into the namespace
[arg ns]. This is by default the namespace [emph macros]. Note that
this is relative namespace name, placing the imported command into a
child of the current namespace. By default all commands are imported,
this can howver be restricted by listing the names of the wanted
commands after the namespace argument.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::macros::menu] [arg menu]]

The description of a menu is converted into a formatted rectangular
block of text, with the menu command characters highlighted using bold
red text.  The result is returned as the result of the command.

[para]

The description, [arg menu], is a dictionary mapping from menu label
to command character.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::macros::frame] [arg string]]

The paragraph of text contained in the string is padded with spaces at
the right margin, after normalizing internal tabs, and then put into a
frame made of box-graphics. The result is returned as the result of
the command.
