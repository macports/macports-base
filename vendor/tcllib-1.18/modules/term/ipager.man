[description]

This package provides a class for the creation of a simple paging
text display.

[section {Class API}]

The package exports a single command, the class command, enabling the
creation of pager instances. Its API is:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd term::interact::pager] [arg object] [arg text] [opt [arg options]...]]

This command creates a new pager object with the name [arg object],
initializes it, and returns the fully qualified name of the object
command as its result.

[para]

The argument is the text to show, possibly followed by configuration
options and their values. The options are explained in the section
[sectref Configuration].

[list_end]

[section {Object API}]

The objects created by the class command provide the methods listed
below:

[list_begin definitions]
[call [arg object] [method interact]]

Show the pager in the screen at the configured location and start
interacting with it. This opens its own event loop for the processing
of incoming characters. The method returns when the interaction has
completed. See section [sectref Interaction] for a description of the
possible interaction.

[call [arg object] [method done]]

This method can be used by user supplied actions to terminate the
interaction with the object.

[call [arg object] [method clear]]

This method can be used by user supplied actions to remove the pager
from the terminal.

[call [arg object] [method text] [arg text]]

This method can be used to change the text shown by the pager.
The pager will reset the dispay to show the first line of the
text at the top.

[call [arg object] [method configure]]
[call [arg object] [method configure] [arg option]]
[call [arg object] [method configure] [arg option] [arg value]...]
[call [arg object] [method cget] [arg option]]

Standard methods to retrieve and configure the options of the pager.

[list_end]

[section Configuration]

A pager instance recognizes the following options:

[list_begin options]
[opt_def -in chan]

Specifies the channel to read character sequences from. Defaults to
[const stdin].

[opt_def -out chan]

Specifies the channel to write the pager contents to. Defaults to
[const stdout].

[opt_def -column int]

Specifies the column of the terminal where the left margin of the
pager display should appear. Defaults to 0, i.e. the left-most
column.

[opt_def -line int]

Specifies the line of the terminal where the top margin of the pager
display should appear. Defaults to 0, i.e. the top-most line.

[opt_def -height int]

Specifies the number of lines of text to show at most in the
display. Defaults to 25.

[opt_def -actions dict]

Specifies a dictionary containing additional actions, using character
sequences as keys. Note that these sequences cannot override the
hardwired sequences described in section [sectref Interaction].

[list_end]

[section Interaction]

A pager object recognizes the control sequences listed below and acts
as described. The user can supply more control sequences to act on via
the configuration, but is not able to overide these defaults.

[list_begin definitions]
[def {Cursor Up}]

The text is scrolled down a single line, making one more line visible
at the top. The pager will not react if the first line of the text is
already shown.

[def {Cursor Down}]

The text is scrolled up a single line, making one more line visible at
the bottom. The pager will not react if the last line of the text is
already shown.

[def {Page Up}]

The text is scrolled down a page. The pager will not react if the
first line of the text is already shown.

[def {Page Down}]

The text is scrolled up a page. The pager will not react if the last
line of the text is already shown.

[def Enter/Return]

The interaction with the object is terminated.
