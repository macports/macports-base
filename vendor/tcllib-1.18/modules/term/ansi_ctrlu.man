[description]

[emph {WARNING}]: This package is unix-specific and depends on the
availability of two unix system commands for terminal control,
i.e. [syscmd stty] and [syscmd tput], both of which have to be found
in the [var {$PATH}]. If any of these two commands is missing the
loading of the package will fail.

[para]

The package provides commands to switch the standard input of the
current process between [term raw] and [term cooked] input modes, and
to query the size of terminals, i.e. the available number of columns
and lines.

[section API]
[subsection Introspection]

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::term::ansi::ctrl::unix::import] [opt [arg ns]] [opt [arg arg]...]]

This command imports some or all attribute commands into the namespace
[arg ns]. This is by default the namespace [emph ctrl]. Note that this
is relative namespace name, placing the imported command into a child
of the current namespace. By default all commands are imported, this
can howver be restricted by listing the names of the wanted commands
after the namespace argument.

[subsection Operations]
[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::ctrl::unix::raw]]

This command switches the standard input of the current process to
[term raw] input mode. This means that from then on all characters
typed by the user are immediately reported to the application instead
of waiting in the OS buffer until the Enter/Return key is received.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::ctrl::unix::cooked]]

This command switches the standard input of the current process to
[term cooked] input mode. This means that from then on all characters
typed by the user are kept in OS buffers for editing until the
Enter/Return key is received.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::ctrl::unix::columns]]

This command queries the terminal connected to the standard input for
the number of columns available for display.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::ctrl::unix::rows]]

This command queries the terminal connected to the standard input for
the number of rows (aka lines) available for display.
