[description]

This package provides the most primitive commands for receiving
characters to a terminal. They are in essence convenient wrappers
around the builtin commands [cmd read] and [cmd fileevent].

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::term::receive::getch] [opt [arg chan]]]

This command reads a single character from the channel with handle
[arg chan] and returns it as the result of the command.

[para]

If not specified [arg chan] defaults to [const stdin].

[para]

It is the responsibility of the caller to make sure that the channel
can provide single characters. On unix this can be done, for example,
by using the command of package [package term::ansi::ctrl::unix].

[call [cmd ::term::receive::listen] [arg cmd] [opt [arg chan]]]

This command sets up a filevent listener for the channel with handle
[arg chan] and invokes the command prefix [arg cmd] whenever
characters have been received, or EOF was reached.

[para]

If not specified [arg chan] defaults to [const stdin].

[para]

The signature of the command prefix is

[list_begin definitions]
[call [arg cmd] [method process] [arg string]]

This method is invoked when characters were received, and [arg string]
holds them for processing.

[call [arg cmd] [method eof]]

This method is invoked when EOF was reached on the channel we listen
on.  It will be the last call to be received by the callback.

[list_end]

[call [cmd ::term::receive::unlisten] [opt [arg chan]]]

This command disables the filevent listener for the channel with handle
[arg chan].

[para]

If not specified [arg chan] defaults to [const stdin].

[list_end]

[vset CATEGORY term]
