[description]

This package provides symbolic names for the ANSI control
sequences. For each sequence a single command is provided which
returns the sequence as its result. None of the commands of this
package write to a channel; that is handled by higher level packages,
like [package term::ansi::send].

[section API]
[subsection Introspection]

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::names]]

This command is for introspection. It returns as its result a list
containing the names of all attribute commands.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::import] [opt [arg ns]] [opt [arg arg]...]]

This command imports some or all attribute commands into the namespace
[arg ns]. This is by default the namespace [emph ctrl]. Note that this
is relative namespace name, placing the imported command into a child
of the current namespace. By default all commands are imported, this
can howver be restricted by listing the names of the wanted commands
after the namespace argument.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::skd] [arg code] [arg str]]

Set Key Definition.
[comment {-- list the possible codes --}]

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::title] [arg str]]

Set the terminal title.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::gron]]

Switch to character/box graphics. I.e. switch to the alternate font.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::groff]]

Switch to regular characters. I.e. switch to the default font.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::tlc]] Character graphics, Top Left Corner.
[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::trc]] Character graphics, Top Right Corner.
[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::brc]] Character graphics, Bottom Right Corner.
[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::blc]] Character graphics, Bottom Left Corner.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::groptim] [arg str]]

Optimize character graphics. The generator commands above create way to many
superfluous commands shifting into and out of the graphics mode. This command
removes all shifts which are not needed. To this end it also knows which
characters will look the same in both modes, to handle strings created outside
of this package.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::clear]]

Clear screen. In essence a sequence of CursorHome + EraseDown.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::init]]

Initialize default and alternate fonts to ASCII and box graphics.

[call [cmd ::term::ansi::code::ctrl::showat] [arg row] [arg col] [arg text]]
