[description]

This package provides commands for fomatting of benchmark results into
human readable text.

[para]

A reader interested in the generation or processing of such results should
go and read [term {bench - Processing benchmark suites}] instead.

[para]

If the bench language itself is the actual interest please start with
the [term {bench language introduction}] and then proceed from there
to the formal [term {bench language specification}].
