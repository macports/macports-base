# Using the indirections below looks to be quite pointless, given that
# they simply substitute the commands for others. I am doing this for
# two reasons.

# First, the rules coming after become self-commenting, i.e. a
# maintainer can immediately see what an argument is supposed to be,
# instead of having to search elsewhere (like the documentation and
# implementation). In this manner our definitions here are a type of
# semantic markup.

# The second reason is that while we have no special checks now we
# cannot be sure if such will (have to) be added in the future. With
# all checking routed through our definitions we now already have the
# basic infrastructure (i.e. hooks) in place in which we can easily
# add any new checks by simply redefining the relevant command, and
# all the rules update on their own. Mostly. This should cover 90% of
# the cases. Sometimes new checks will require to create deeper
# distinctions between different calls of the same thing. For such we
# may have to update the rules as well, to provide the necessary
# information to the checker.
