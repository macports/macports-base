[description]
[para]

This document specifies both names and syntax of all the commands
which together are the docidx markup language, version 1.

As this document is intended to be a reference the commands are listed
in alphabetical order, and the descriptions are relatively short.

A beginner should read the much more informally written
[term {docidx language introduction}] first.

[section Commands]
[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd comment] [arg plaintext]]

Index markup. The argument text is marked up as a comment standing
outside of the actual text of the document. Main use is in free-form
text.

[call [cmd include] [arg filename]]

Templating. The contents of the named file are interpreted as text
written in the docidx markup and processed in the place of the
include command. The markup in the file has to be self-contained. It
is not possible for a markup command to cross the file boundaries.

[call [cmd index_begin] [arg text] [arg title]]

Document structure. The command to start an index. The arguments are a
label for the whole group of documents the index refers to
([arg text]) and the overall title text for the index ([arg title]),
without markup.

[para]

The label often is the name of the package (or extension) the
documents belong to.

[call [cmd index_end]]

Document structure. Command to end an index. Anything in the document
coming after this command is in error.

[call [cmd key] [arg text]]

Index structure. This command adds the keyword [arg text] to the
index.

[call [cmd lb]]

Text. The command is replaced with a left bracket. Use in free-form
text. Required to avoid interpretation of a left bracket as the start
of a markup command. Its usage is restricted to the arguments of other
markup commands.

[call [cmd manpage] [arg file] [arg text]]

Index structure. This command adds an element to the index which
refers to a document. The document is specified through the symbolic
name [arg file]. The [arg text] argument is used to label the
reference.

[para]

Symbolic names are used to preserve the convertibility of this format
to any output format. The actual name of the file will be inserted by
the chosen formatting engine when converting the input. This will be
based on a mapping from symbolic to actual names given to the engine.

[call [cmd rb]]

Text. The command is replaced with a right bracket. Use in free-form
text. Required to avoid interpretation of a right bracket as the end
of a markup command. Its usage is restricted to the arguments of other
commands.

[call [cmd url] [arg url] [arg label]]

Index structure. This is the second command to add an element to the
index. To refer to a document it is not using a symbolic name however,
but a (possibly format-specific) url describing the exact location of
the document indexed here.

[call [cmd vset] [arg varname] [arg value] ]

Templating. In this form the command sets the named document variable
to the specified [arg value]. It does not generate output. I.e. the
command is replaced by the empty string.

[call [cmd vset] [arg varname]]

Templating. In this form the command is replaced by the value of the
named document variable

[list_end]

[vset CATEGORY doctools]
[include ../doctools2base/include/feedback.inc]
[manpage_end]
