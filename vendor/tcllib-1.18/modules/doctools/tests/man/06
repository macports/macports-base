[comment {
    nested lists, same and different types, examples have examples at
    least three levels deep, for a proper inner level, i.e. not only
    first/last level, but something truly in the middle. Also three
    list items of the relevant on each level, see the proper handling
    of indentations. For that we also need paragraphs in the items.
