*	docidx / doctoc package documentation - sync with code
*	doctools package documentation		ditto




*	Add a tk-based editor application which loads and generates
	the format (and can invoke the processor to generate the other
	formats).

*	Rewrite formatters to use generator packages for their
	output format. Example: HTML => tcllib/html package
	to generate the tags. Less quoting issues. Has escape
	handlers.

=======

Note that running multiple formatters in parallel is possible, but
requires that the whole chain of expander, checker and engine are
replicated per format. The reason for this is that engine generates
some output, but always passes it up to its caller, i.e the expander,
for final composition. This is especially true for nested macro
invocations where the intermediate results generated by the engine are
passed through the expander to be sent down again into the engine. For
multiple engines we have to combine and then separate the results for
the various formats. The problem is to distinguish between data coming
from the engine and text coming from the outside, for the latter has
to be replicated instead of separated. This is possible, but I do not
believe that it is worth the additional complexity of the
implemementation.
