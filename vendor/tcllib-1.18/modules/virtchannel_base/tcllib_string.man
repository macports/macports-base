[para]

The [package tcl::chan::string] package provides a command creating
channels which live purely in memory. They provide random-access,
i.e. are seekable.

In contrast to the channels created by [package tcl::chan::memchan]
they are read-only however, their content is provided at the time of
construction and immutable afterward.

[para] Packages related to this are [package tcl::chan::memchan] and
[package tcl::chan::variable].

[para] The internal [package TclOO] class implementing the channel
handler is a sub-class of the [package tcl::chan::events] framework.
