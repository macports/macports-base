[para]

The [package tcl::chan::cat] package provides a command creating
concatenation channels. These are non-seekable channels owning a list
of subordinate channels whose contents they return in order, until all
are exhausted. In this manner the channel is the concatentation of the
contents of all the sub-ordinate channels.

[para] Note that the created channels take ownership of the channels
they were constructed with. Whenever they have exhausted one of their
channel it will be closed. Similarly, closing the cat channel will
close all the sub-ordinates it still has.

[para] The internal [package TclOO] class implementing the channel
handler is a sub-class of the [package tcl::chan::core] framework.

[para] Event handling is delegated to the currently active sub-channel.
