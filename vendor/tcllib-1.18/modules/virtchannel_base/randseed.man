The [package tcl::randomseed] package provides a a few utility commands

[section API]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::tcl::randomseed]]

This command creates returns a list of seed integers suitable as seed
argument for random channels. The numbers are derived from the process
id, current time, and Tcl random number generator.

[call [cmd ::tcl::combine] [arg seed1] [arg seed2]]

This command takes to seed lists and combines them into a single list
by XORing them elementwise, modulo 256. If the lists are not of equial
length the shorter of the two is padded with 0s before merging.
