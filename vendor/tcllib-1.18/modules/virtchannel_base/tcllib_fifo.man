[description]
[para]

The [package tcl::chan::fifo] package provides a command creating
channels which live purely in memory. Access is fifo-like, i.e. things
are read out of the channel in the order they were written to it.

This is equivalent to the fifo channels provided by the package
[package Mmechan], except that this is written in pure Tcl, not C. On
the other hand, [package Memchan] is usable with Tcl 8.4 and before,
whereas this package requires Tcl 8.5 or higher, and [package TclOO].

[para] The internal [package TclOO] class implementing the channel
handler is a sub-class of the [package tcl::chan::events] framework.
