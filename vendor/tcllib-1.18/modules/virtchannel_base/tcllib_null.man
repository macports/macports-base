The [package tcl::chan::null] package provides a command creating null
channels, i.e. write-only channels which immediately forget whatever
is written to them. This is equivalent to the null channels provided by
the package [package Memchan], except that this is written in pure Tcl,
not C. On the other hand, [package Memchan] is usable with Tcl 8.4 and
before, whereas this package requires Tcl 8.5 or higher, and
[package TclOO].

[para] Packages related to this are [package tcl::chan::zero] and
[package tcl::chan::nullzero].

[para] The internal [package TclOO] class implementing the channel
handler is a sub-class of the [package tcl::chan::events] framework.
