[para]

The [package tcl::chan::random] package provides a command creating
random channels, i.e. read-only channels which return an infinite
stream of pseudo-random characters upon reading. This is similar to
the random channels provided by the package [package Memchan], except
that this is written in pure Tcl, not C, and uses a much simpler
generator as well. On the other hand, [package Memchan] is usable with
Tcl 8.4 and before, whereas this package requires Tcl 8.5 or higher,
and TclOO.

[para] The internal [package TclOO] class implementing the channel
handler is a sub-class of the [package tcl::chan::events] framework.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::tcl::chan::random] [arg seed]]

This command creates a new random channel and returns its handle.

The seed is a list of integer numbers used to initialize the
internal feedback shift register of the generator.
