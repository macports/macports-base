[list_begin definitions]

[call  [cmd ::pop3d::new] [opt [arg serverName]]]

This command creates a new server object with an associated global Tcl
command whose name is [arg serverName].

[list_end]

The command [cmd serverName] may be used to invoke various operations
on the server.  It has the following general form:

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd serverName] [arg option] [opt [arg "arg arg ..."]]]

[arg Option] and the [arg arg]s determine the exact behavior of the
command.

[list_end]

[para]

A pop3 server can be started on any port the caller has permission for
from the operating system. The default port will be 110, which is the
port defined by the standard specified in
RFC 1939 ([uri http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt]).

After creating, configuring and starting a the server object will
listen for and accept connections on that port and handle them
according to the POP3 protocol.

[para]

[emph Note:] The server provided by this module will handle only the
basic protocol by itself. For the higher levels of user authentication
and handling of the actual mailbox contents callbacks will be invoked.

[para]

The following commands are possible for server objects:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [arg serverName] [method up]]

After this call the server will listen for connections on its configured port.

[call [arg serverName] [method down]]

After this call the server will stop listening for connections. This
does not affect existing connections.

[call [arg serverName] [method destroy] [opt [arg mode]]]

Destroys the server object. Currently open connections are handled
depending on the chosen mode.

The provided [arg mode]s are:

[list_begin definitions]

[def [const kill]]

Destroys the server immediately, and forcefully closes all currently
open connections. This is the default mode.

[def [const defer]]

Stops the server from accepting new connections and will actually
destroy it only after the last of the currently open connections for
the server is closed.

[list_end]

[call [arg serverName] [method configure]]

Returns a list containing all options and their current values in a
format suitable for use by the command [cmd {array set}]. The options
themselves are described in section [sectref Options].

[call [arg serverName] [method configure] [arg -option]]

Returns the current value of the specified option. This is an alias
for the method [method cget]. The options themselves are described in
section [sectref Options].

[call [arg serverName] [method configure] [arg {-option value}]...]

Sets the specified option to the provided value. The options
themselves are described in section [sectref Options].

[call [arg serverName] [method cget] [arg -option]]

Returns the current value of the specified option. The options
themselves are described in section [sectref Options].

[call [arg serverName] [method conn] list]

Returns a list containing the ids of all connections currently open.

[call [arg serverName] [method conn] state [arg id]]

Returns a list suitable for [lb][cmd {array set}][rb] containing the
state of the connection referenced by [arg id].

[list_end]

[section Options]

The following options are available to pop3 server objects.

[list_begin definitions]

[def "[option -port] [arg port]"]

Defines the [arg port] to listen on for new connections. Default is
110. This option is a bit special. If [arg port] is set to "0" the
server, or rather the operating system, will select a free port on its
own. When querying [option -port] the id of this chosen port will be
returned. Changing the port while the server is up will neither change
the returned value, nor will it change on which port the server is
listening on. Only after resetting the server via a call to

[method down] followed by a call to [method up] will the new port take
effect. It is at that time that the value returned when querying
[option -port] will change too.

[def "[option -auth] [arg command]"]

Defines a [arg command] prefix to call whenever the authentication of
a user is required. If no such command is specified the server will
reject all users. The interface which has to be provided by the
command prefix is described in section [sectref Authentication].

[def "[option -storage] [arg command]"]

Defines a [arg command] prefix to call whenever the handling of
mailbox contents is required. If no such command is specified the
server will claim that all mailboxes are empty. The interface which
has to be provided by the command prefix is described in section
[sectref Mailboxes].

[def "[option -socket] [arg command]"]

Defines a [arg command] prefix to call for opening the listening socket.
This can be used to make the pop3 server listen on a SSL socket
as provided by the [package tls] package, see the command [cmd tls::socket].

[list_end]

[section Authentication]

Here we describe the interface which has to be provided by the
authentication callback so that pop3 servers following the interface
of this module are able to use it.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [arg authCmd] [method exists] [arg name]]

This method is given a user[arg name] and has to return a boolean
value telling whether or not the specified user exists.

[call [arg authCmd] [method lookup] [arg name]]

This method is given a user[arg name] and has to return a two-element
list containing the password for this user and a storage reference, in
this order.

[para]

The storage reference is passed unchanged to the storage callback, see
sections [sectref Options] and [sectref Mailboxes] for either the
option defining it and or the interface to provide, respectively.

[list_end]

[section Mailboxes]

Here we describe the interface which has to be provided by the storage
callback so that pop3 servers following the interface of this module
are able to use it. The [arg mbox] argument is the storage reference
as returned by the [method lookup] method of the authentication
command, see section [sectref Authentication].

[list_begin definitions]

[call [arg storageCmd] [method dele] [arg mbox] [arg msgList]]]

Deletes the messages whose numeric ids are contained in the
[arg msgList] from the mailbox specified via [arg mbox].

[call [arg storageCmd] [method lock] [arg mbox]]

This method locks the specified mailbox for use by a single connection
to the server. This is necessary to prevent havoc if several
connections to the same mailbox are open. The complementary method is
[method unlock]. The command will return true if the lock could be set
successfully or false if not.

[call [arg storageCmd] [method unlock] [arg mbox]]

This is the complementary method to [method lock], it revokes the lock
on the specified mailbox.

[call [arg storageCmd] [method size] [arg mbox] [opt [arg msgId]]]

Determines the size of the message specified through its id in
[arg msgId], in bytes, and returns this number. The command will
return the size of the whole maildrop if no message id was specified.

[call [arg storageCmd] [method stat] [arg mbox]]

Determines the number of messages in the specified mailbox and returns
this number.

[call [arg storageCmd] [method get] [arg mbox] [arg msgId]]

Returns a handle for the specified message. This handle is a mime
token following the interface described in the documentation of
package [package mime]. The pop3 server will use the functionality of
the mime token to send the mail to the requestor at the other end of a
pop3 connection.

[list_end]

[section {Secure mail transfer}]

The option [option -socket] (see [sectref Options]) enables users of
the package to override how the server opens its listening socket.

The envisioned main use is the specification of the [cmd tls::socket]
command, see package [package tls], to secure the communication.

[example {
	package require tls
	tls::init \\
		...

	pop3d::new S -socket tls::socket
	...
}]
