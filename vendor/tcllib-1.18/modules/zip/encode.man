[description]
[para]

This package provides a class for the generation of zip archives.

[section {Class API}]

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::zipfile::encode] [opt [arg objectName]]]

The class command constructs encoder instances, i.e. objects. The
result of the command is the fully-qualified name of the instance
command.

[para]

If no [arg objectName] is specified the class will generate and use an
automatic name. If the [arg objectName] was specified, but is not
fully qualified the command will be created in the current namespace.

[comment ---------------------------------------------------------------------]
[call [cmd <encoder>] [method comment:] [arg text]]

This method specifies the text of the global comment for the archive.

The result of the method is the empty string.

In case of multiple calls to this method for the same encoder the data
from the last call prevails over all previous texts.

[comment ---------------------------------------------------------------------]
[call [cmd <encoder>] [method file:] [arg dst] [arg owned] [arg src] \
     [opt [arg noCompress]]]

This method adds a new file to the archive.

The contents of the file are found in the filesystem at [arg src], and
will be stored in the archive under path [arg dst].

If the file is declared as [arg owned] by the archive the original
file will be deleted when the archive is constructed and written.

If [arg noCompress] is set to [const true] the file will not be
compressed on writing. Otherwise (the default) the file is compressed
if it is advantageous.

The result of the method is an empty string.

[comment ---------------------------------------------------------------------]
[call [cmd <encoder>] [method write] [arg archive]]

This method takes the global comment and all added files, encodes them
as a zip archive and stores the result at path [arg archive] in the
filesystem.

All added files which were owned by the archive are deleted at this
point.

On the issue of ordering, the files are added to the archive in the
same order as they were specified via [method file:]. [emph Note] that
this behaviour is new for version 0.4 and higher. Before 0.4 no
specific order was documented. It was lexicographically sorted. The
change was made to support [cmd zip]-based file formats which require
a specific order of files in the archive, for example [file .epub].
