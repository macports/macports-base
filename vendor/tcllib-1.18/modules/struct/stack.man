[description]

The [namespace ::struct] namespace contains a commands for processing
finite stacks.

[para]

It exports a single command, [cmd ::struct::stack]. All functionality
provided here can be reached through a subcommand of this command.

[para]

[emph Note:] As of version 1.3.3 of this package a critcl based C
implementation is available. This implementation however requires Tcl
8.4 to run.

[para]

The [cmd ::struct::stack] command creates a new stack object with an
associated global Tcl command whose name is [emph stackName].  This
command may be used to invoke various operations on the stack.  It has
the following general form:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [arg stackName] [cmd option] [opt [arg "arg arg ..."]]]

[arg Option] and the [arg arg]s determine the exact behavior of the
command.  The following commands are possible for stack objects:

[call [arg stackName] [method clear]]

Remove all items from the stack.

[call [arg stackName] [method destroy]]

Destroy the stack, including its storage space and associated command.

[call [arg stackName] [method get]]

Returns the whole contents of the stack as a list, without removing
them from the stack.

[call [arg stackName] [method getr]]

A variant of [method get], which returns the contents in reversed order.

[call [arg stackName] [method peek] [opt [arg count]]]

Return the top [arg count] items of the stack, without removing them from
the stack.  If [arg count] is not specified, it defaults to 1.  If
[arg count] is 1, the result is a simple string; otherwise, it is a
list.  If specified, [arg count] must be greater than or equal to 1.

If there are not enoughs items on the stack to fulfull the request,
this command will throw an error.

[call [arg stackName] [method peekr] [opt [arg count]]]

A variant of [method peek], which returns the items in reversed order.

[call [arg stackName] [method trim] [opt [arg newsize]]]

Shrinks the stack to contain at most [arg newsize] elements and
returns a list containing the elements which were removed. Nothing is
done if the stack is already at the specified size, or smaller. In
that case the result is the empty list.

[call [arg stackName] [method trim*] [opt [arg newsize]]]

A variant of [method trim] which performs the shrinking, but does not
return the removed elements.

[call [arg stackName] [method pop] [opt [arg count]]]

Return the top [arg count] items of the stack, and remove them
from the stack.  If [arg count] is not specified, it defaults to 1.
If [arg count] is 1, the result is a simple string; otherwise, it is a
list.  If specified, [arg count] must be greater than or equal to 1.

If there are not enoughs items on the stack to fulfull the request,
this command will throw an error.

[call [arg stackName] [method push] [arg item] [opt [arg item...]]]

Push the [arg item] or items specified onto the stack.  If more than
one [arg item] is given, they will be pushed in the order they are
listed.

[call [arg stackName] [method size]]

Return the number of items on the stack.
