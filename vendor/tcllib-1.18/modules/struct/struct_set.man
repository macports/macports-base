[para]

The [cmd ::struct::set] namespace contains several useful commands for
processing finite sets.

[para]

It exports only a single command, [cmd struct::set]. All
functionality provided here can be reached through a subcommand of
this command.

[para]

[emph Note:] As of version 2.2 of this package a critcl based C
implementation is available. This implementation however requires Tcl
8.4 to run.

[section COMMANDS]
[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method empty] [arg set]]

Returns a boolean value indicating if the [arg set] is
empty ([const true]), or not ([const false]).

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method size] [arg set]]

Returns an integer number greater than or equal to zero. This is the
number of elements in the [arg set]. In other words, its cardinality.

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method contains] [arg set] [arg item]]

Returns a boolean value indicating if the [arg set] contains the
element [arg item] ([const true]), or not ([const false]).

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method union] [opt [arg set1]...]]

Computes the set containing the union of [arg set1], [arg set2],
etc., i.e. "[arg set1] + [arg set2] + ...", and returns this set
as the result of the command.

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method intersect] [opt [arg set1]...]]

Computes the set containing the intersection of [arg set1],
[arg set2], etc., i.e. "[arg set1] * [arg set2] * ...", and
returns this set as the result of the command.

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method difference] [arg set1] [arg set2]]

Computes the set containing the difference of [arg set1] and
[arg set2], i.e. ("[arg set1] - [arg set2]") and returns this
set as the result of the command.

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method symdiff] [arg set1] [arg set2]]

Computes the set containing the symmetric difference of [arg set1] and
[arg set2], i.e. ("([arg set1] - [arg set2]) + ([arg set2] - [arg set1])")
and returns this set as the result of the command.

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method intersect3] [arg set1] [arg set2]]

This command is a combination of the methods [method intersect] and
[method difference].

It returns a three-element list containing "[arg set1]*[arg set2]",
"[arg set1]-[arg set2]", and "[arg set2]-[arg set1]", in this
order. In other words, the intersection of the two parameter sets, and
their differences.

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method equal] [arg set1] [arg set2]]

Returns a boolean value indicating if the two sets are equal
([const true]) or not ([const false]).

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method include] [arg svar] [arg item]]

The element [arg item] is added to the set specified by the variable
name in [arg svar]. The return value of the command is empty. This is
the equivalent of [cmd lappend] for sets. If the variable named by
[arg svar] does not exist it will be created.

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method exclude] [arg svar] [arg item]]

The element [arg item] is removed from the set specified by the
variable name in [arg svar]. The return value of the command is
empty. This is a near-equivalent of [cmd lreplace] for sets.

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method add] [arg svar] [arg set]]

All the element of [arg set] are added to the set specified by the
variable name in [arg svar]. The return value of the command is
empty. This is like the method [method include], but for the addition
of a whole set. If the variable named by [arg svar] does not exist it
will be created.

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method subtract] [arg svar] [arg set]]

All the element of [arg set] are removed from the set specified by the
variable name in [arg svar]. The return value of the command is
empty. This is like the method [method exclude], but for the removal
of a whole set.

[call [cmd ::struct::set] [method subsetof] [arg A] [arg B]]

Returns a boolean value indicating if the set [arg A] is a true
subset of or equal to the set [arg B] ([const true]), or not
([const false]).
