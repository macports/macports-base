EXIF                        The EXIF Package               February 2002


1. Synopsis

       package provide exif 1.0

   The EXIF package is a recoding of Chris Breeze's Perl package to do
   the same thing.  This version accepts a channel as input and returns
   a serialized array with all the recognised fields parsed out.

   There is also a function to obtain a list of all possible field names
   that might be present, which is useful in building GUIs that present
   such information.

2. Details

       array set answer [exif::analyze $channel]

   $channel should be an open file handle rewound to the start.  It does
   not need to be seekable.  $channel will be set to binary mode and is
   left wherever it happens to stop being parsed, usually at the end of
   the file or the start of the image data.  You must open and close the
   stream yourself.  If no error is thrown, the return value is a
   serialized array with informative English text about what was found
   in the EXIF block.  Failure during parsing or I/O throw errors.

       set names [exif::fieldnames]

   This returns a list of all possible field names.  That is, the array
   returned by exif::analyze will not contain keys that are not listed
   in the return from exif::fieldnames.  Of course, if information is
   missing in the image file, exif::analyze may not return all the
   fields listed in the return from exif::fieldnames.  This function is
   expected to be primarily useful for building GUIs to display results.
   N.B.: Read the implementation of exif::fieldnames before modifying
   the implementation of exif::analyze.
