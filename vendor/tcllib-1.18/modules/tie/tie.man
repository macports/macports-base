[description]

The [package tie] package provides a framework for the creation of
persistent Tcl array variables. It should be noted that the provided
mechanism is generic enough to also allow its usage for the
distribution of the contents of Tcl arrays over multiple threads and
processes, i.e. communication.

[para]

This, persistence and communication, is accomplished by [term tying])
a Tcl array variable to a [term {data source}]. Examples of data
sources are other Tcl arrays and files.

[para]

It should be noted that a single Tcl array variable can be tied to
more than one [term {data source}]. It is this feature which allows
the framework to be used for communication as well. Just tie several
Tcl arrays in many client processes to a Tcl array in a server and all
changes to any of them will be distributed to all. Less centralized
variants of this are of course possible as well.

[section {USING TIES}]

[subsection {TIE API}]

This section describes the basic API used to establish and remove ties
between Tcl array variables and data sources. This interface is the
only one a casual user has to be concerned about. The following
sections about the various internal interfaces can be safely skipped.

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::tie::tie] [arg arrayvarname] [arg options]... [arg dstype] [arg dsname]...]

This command establishes a tie between the Tcl array whose name is
provided by the argument [arg arrayvarname] and the

[term {data source}] identified by the [arg dstype] and its series of
[arg dsname] arguments. All changes made to the Tcl array after this
command returns will be saved to the [term {data source}] for
safekeeping (or distribution).

[para]

The result of the command is always a token which identifies the new
tie. This token can be used later to destroy this specific tie.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def varname arrayvarname in]

The name of the Tcl array variable to connect the new tie to.

[arg_def name|command dstype in]

This argument specifies the type of the [term {data source}] we wish
to access.

The [arg dstype] can be one of [const log], [const array],

[const remotearray], [const file], [const growfile], or

[const dsource]; in addition, the programmer can register additional
data source types.

Each [arg dstype] is followed by one or more arguments that identify
the [term {data source}] to which the array is to be tied.

[arg_def string dsname in]

The series of [arg dsname] arguments coming after the [arg dstype]
identifies the [term {data source}] we wish to connect to, and has to
be appropriate for the chosen type.

[list_end]
[para]

The command understands a number of additional options which guide the
process of setting up the connection between Tcl array and
[term {data source}].

[para]

[list_begin options]
[opt_def -open]

The Tcl array for the new tie is [term loaded] from the
[term {data source}], and the previously existing contents of the Tcl
array are erased. Care is taken to [emph not] erase the previous
contents should the creation of the tie fail.

[para]

This option and the option [option -save] exclude each other. If
neither this nor option [option -save] are specified then this option
is assumed as default.

[opt_def -save]

The Tcl array for the new tie is [term saved] to the
[term {data source}], and the previously existing contents of the
[term {data source}] are erased.

[para]

This option and the option [option -open] exclude each other. If
neither this nor option [option -open] are specified then option
[option -open] is assumed as default.

[opt_def -merge]

Using this option prevents the erasure of any previously existing
content and merges the data instead. It can be specified in
conjunction with either [option -open] or [option -save]. They
determine how data existing in both Tcl array and
[term {data source}], i.e duplicates, are dealt with.

[para]

When used with [option -open] data in the [term {data source}] has
precedence.

In other words, for duplicates the data in the [term {data source}] is
loaded into the Tcl array.

[para]

When used with [option -save] data in the Tcl array has precedence. In
other words, for duplicates the data in the Tcl array is saved into
the [term {data source}].

[list_end]
[para]

[call [cmd ::tie::untie] [arg arrayvarname] [opt [arg token]]]

This command dissolves one or more ties associated with the Tcl array
named by [arg arrayvarname]. If no [arg token] is specified then all
ties to that Tcl array are dissolved. Otherwise only the tie the token
stands for is removed, if it is actually connected to the
array. Trying to remove a specific tie not belonging to the provided
array will cause an error.

[para]

It should be noted that while severing a tie will destroy management
information internal to the package the [term {data source}] which was
handled by the tie will not be touched, only closed.

[para]

After the command returns none of changes made to the array will be
saved to the [term {data source}] anymore.

[para]

The result of the command is an empty string.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def varname arrayname in]

The name of a Tcl array variable which may have ties.

[arg_def handle token in]

A handle representing a specific tie. This argument is optional.

[list_end]
[para]

[call [cmd ::tie::info] [method ties] [arg arrayvarname]]

This command returns a list of ties associated with the Tcl array
variable named by [arg arrayvarname]. The result list will be empty if
the variable has no ties associated with it.

[call [cmd ::tie::info] [method types]]

This command returns a dictionary of registered types, and the class
commands they are associated with.

[call [cmd ::tie::info] [method type] [arg dstype]]

This command returns the fully resolved class command for a type
name. This means that the command will follow a chain of type
definitions ot its end.

[list_end]

[subsection {STANDARD DATA SOURCE TYPES}]

This package provides the six following types as examples and standard
data sources.

[list_begin definitions]

[def [const log]]

This [term {data source}] does not maintain any actual data, nor
persistence. It does not accept any identifying arguments. All changes
are simply logged to [const stdout].

[def [const array]]

This [term {data source}] uses a regular Tcl array as the origin of
the persistent data. It accepts a single identifying argument, the
name of this Tcl array. All changes are mirrored to that array.

[def [const remotearray]]

This [term {data source}] is similar to [const array]. The difference
is that the Tcl array to which we are mirroring is not directly
accessible, but through a [cmd send]-like command.

[para]

It accepts three identifying arguments, the name of the other Tcl
array, the command prefix for the [cmd send]-like accessor command,
and an identifier for the remote entity hosting the array, in this
order. All changes are mirrored to that array, via the command
prefix. All commands will be executed in the context of the global
namespace.

[para]

[cmd send]-like means that the command prefix has to have [cmd send]
syntax and semantics. I.e. it is a channel over which we can send
arbitrary commands to some other entity.

The remote array [term {data source}] however uses only the commands
[cmd set], [cmd unset], [cmd {array exists}], [cmd {array names}], [cmd {array set}], and
[cmd {array get}] to retrieve and set values in the remote array.

[para]

The command prefix and the entity id are separate to allow the data
source to use options like [option -async] when assembling the actual
commands.

[para]

Examples of command prefixes, listed with the id of the remote entity,
without options. In reality only the part before the id is the command
prefix:

[list_begin definitions]
[def "[cmd send] [arg tkname]"]

The Tcl array is in a remote interpreter and is accessed via Tk's X
communication.

[def "[cmd {comm::comm send}] [arg hostportid]"]

The Tcl array is in a remote interpreter and is accessed through a
socket.

[def "[cmd {thread::send}] [arg threadid]"]

The Tcl array is in a remote interpreter in a different thread of this
process.

[list_end]
[para]

[def [const file]]

This [term {data source}] uses a single file as origin of the
persistent data. It accepts a single identifying argument, the path to
this file. The file has to be both readable and writable. It may not
exist, the [term {data source}] will create it in that case. This (and
only this) situation will require that the directory for the file
exists and is writable as well.

[para]

All changes are saved in the file, as proper Tcl commands, one command
per operation. In other words, the file will always contain a proper
Tcl script.

[para]

If the file exists when the tie using it is set up, then it will be
compacted, i.e. superfluous operations are removed, if the operations
log stored in it contains either at least one operation clearing the
whole array, or at least 1.5 times more operations than entries in the
loaded array.

[def [const growfile]]

This [term {data source}] is like [const file] in terms of the storage
medium for the array data, and how it is configured. In constrast to
the former it however assumes and ensures that the tied array will
never shrink. I.e. the creation of new array entries, and the
modification of existing entries is allowed, but the deletion of
entries is not, and causes the data source to throw errors.

[para]

This restriction allows us to simplify both file format and access to
the file radically. For one, the file is read only once and the
internal cache cannot be invalidated. Second, writing data is reduced
to a simple append, and no compaction step is necessary. The format of
the contents is the string representation of a dictionary which can be
incrementally extended forever at the end.

[def [const dsource]]

This [term {data source}] uses an explicitly specified
[term {data source object}] as the source for the persistent
data. It accepts a single identifying argument, the command prefix,
i.e. object command.

[para]

To use this type it is necessary to know how the framework manages
ties and what [sectref dso {data source objects}] are.

[para]

All changes are delegated to the specified object.

[list_end]

[section {CREATING NEW DATA SOURCES}]

This section is of no interest to the casual user of ties. Only
developers wishing to create new data sources have to know the
information provided herein.

[subsection {DATA SOURCE OBJECTS} dso]

All ties are represented internally by an in-memory object which
mediates between the tie framework and the specific
[term {data source}], like an array, file, etc.
This is the [term {data source object}].

[para]

Its class, the [sectref dsc {data source class}] is [emph not] generic,
but specific to the type of the [term {data source}]. Writing a new
[term {data source}] requires us to write such a class, and then
registering it with the framework as a new type.

[para]

The following subsections describe the various APIs a
[sectref dsc {data source class}] and the objects it generates will have
to follow to be compatible with the tie framework.

[para]

Data source objects are normally automatically created and destroyed
by the framework when a tie is created, or removed. This management
can be explicitly bypassed through the usage of the "dsource" type.

The [term {data source}] for this type is a
[term {data source object}] itself, and this object is outside of the
scope of the tie framework and not managed by it.

In other words, this type allows the creation of ties which talk to
pre-existing [term {data source object}]s, and these objects will
survive the removal of the ties using them as well.

[subsection {REGISTERING A NEW DATA SOURCE CLASS}]

After a [sectref dsc {data source class}] has been written it is necessary
to register it as a new type with the framework.

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::tie::register] [arg dsclasscmd] [const as] [arg dstype]]

Using this command causes the tie framework to remember the class
command [arg dsclasscmd] of a [sectref dsc {data source class}] under the
type name [arg dstype].

[para]

After the call the argument [arg dstype] of the basic user command
[cmd ::tie::tie] will accept [arg dstype] as a type name and translate
it internally to the appropriate class command for the creation of
[sectref dso {data source objects}] for the new [term {data source}].

[list_end]

[subsection {DATA SOURCE CLASS} dsc]

Each data source class is represented by a single command, also called
the [term {class command}], or [term {object creation command}]. Its
syntax is

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd {dsclasscmd}] [arg objname] [opt [arg dsname]...]]

The first argument of the class command is the name of the
[term {data source object}] to create.

The framework itself will always supply the string [const %AUTO%], to
signal that the class command has to generate not only the object, but
the object name as well.

[para]

This is followed by a series of arguments identifying the data source
the new object is for. These are the same [arg dsname] arguments which
are given to the basic user command [cmd ::tie::tie]. Their actual
meaning is dependent on the [term {data source class}].

[para]

The result of the class command has to be the fully-qualified name of
the new [term {data source object}], i.e. the name of the
[term {object command}].

The interface this command has to follow is described in the section
[sectref {DATA SOURCE OBJECT API}]

[list_end]
[para]

[subsection {DATA SOURCE OBJECT API}]

Please read the section [sectref dsc] first, to know
how to generate new [term {object commands}].

[para]

Each [term {object command}] for a [term {data source}] object has to
provide at least the methods listed below for proper inter-operation
with the tie framework. Note that the names of most of the methods
match the subcommands of the builtin [cmd array] command.

[para]
[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ds] [method destroy]]

This method is called when the object [cmd ds] is destroyed. It now
has to release all its internal resources associated with the external
data source.

[call [cmd ds] [method names]]

This command has to return a list containing the names of all keys
found in the [term {data source}] the object talks to. This is
equivalent to [cmd {array names}].

[call [cmd ds] [method size]]

This command has to return an integer number specifying the number of
keys found in the [term {data source}] the object talks to. This is
equivalent to [cmd {array size}].

[call [cmd ds] [method get]]

This command has to return a dictionary containing the data found in
the [term {data source}] the object talks to. This is equivalent to
[cmd {array get}].

[call [cmd ds] [method set] [arg dict]]

This command takes a dictionary and adds its contents to the data
source the object talks to. This is equivalent to [cmd {array set}].

[call [cmd ds] [method unset] [opt [arg pattern]]]

This command takes a pattern and removes all elements whose keys
matching it from the [term {data source}]. If no pattern is specified
it defaults to [const *], causing the removal of all elements. This
is nearly equivalent to [cmd {array unset}].

[call [cmd ds] [method setv] [arg index] [arg value]]

This command has to save the [arg value] in the [term {data source}]
the object talks to, under the key [arg index].

[para]

The result of the command is ignored. If an error is thrown then this
error will show up as error of the set operation which caused the
method call.

[call [cmd ds] [method unsetv] [arg index]]

This command has to remove the value under the key [arg index] from
the [term {data source}] the object talks to.

[para]

The result of the command is ignored. If an error is thrown then this
error will show up as error of the unset operation which caused the
method call.

[call [cmd ds] [method getv] [arg index]]

This command has to return the value for the key [arg index] in the
[term {data source}] the object talks to.

[list_end]

And here a small table comparing the [term {data source}] methods to
the regular Tcl commands for accessing an array.

[para]
[example {
        Regular Tcl             Data source
        -----------             -----------
        array names a           ds names
        array size  a           ds size
        array get   a           ds get
        array set   a dict      ds set   dict
        array unset a pattern   ds unset ?pattern?
        -----------             -----------
        set a($idx) $val        ds setv   idx val
        unset a($idx)           ds unsetv idx
        $a($idx)                ds getv   idx
        -----------             -----------
