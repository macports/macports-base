[description]
[para]

The [package asn] package provides [emph partial] de- and encoder
commands for BER encoded ASN.1 data. It can also be used for
decoding DER, which is a restricted subset of BER.

[para]

ASN.1 is a standard [term {Abstract Syntax Notation}], and BER are its
[term {Basic Encoding Rules}].

[para]

See [uri http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/en/standards/index.htm] for more
information about the standard.

Laboratories Technical Note by Burton S. Kaliski Jr. (Revised November
1, 1993). A text version of this note is part of the module sources
and should be read by any implementor.

[subsection DECODER]

General notes:

[list_begin enumerated]
[enum]
Nearly all decoder commands take two arguments. These arguments are variable
names, except for [cmd ::asn::asnGetResponse]. The first variable
contains the encoded ASN value to decode at the beginning, and more,
and the second variable is where the value is stored to. The remainder
of the input after the decoded value is stored back into the
datavariable.

[enum]
After extraction the data variable is always modified first, before by
writing the extracted value to its variable. This means that if both
arguments refer to the same variable, it will always contain the
extracted value after the call, and not the remainder of the input.

[subsection {HANDLING TAGS}]

Working with ASN.1 you often need to decode tagged values, which use a tag thats different
from the universal tag for a type. In those cases you have to replace the tag with the universal tag
used for the type, to decode the value.

To decode a tagged value use the [cmd ::asn::asnRetag] to change the tag to the appropriate type
to use one of the decoders for primitive values.

To help with this the module contains three functions:

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::asn::asnPeekTag] [arg data_var] [arg tag_var] [arg tagtype_var] [arg constr_var]]

The [cmd ::asn::asnPeekTag] command can be used to take a peek at the data and decode the tag value, without
removing it from the data. The [arg tag_var] gets set to the tag number, while the [arg tagtype_var] gets set
to the class of the tag. (Either UNIVERSAL, CONTEXT, APPLICATION or PRIVATE). The [arg constr_var] is set to 1 if the
tag is for a constructed value, and to 0 for not constructed. It returns the length of the tag.

[call [cmd ::asn::asnTag] [arg tagnumber] [opt [arg class]] [opt [arg tagstyle]]]

The [cmd ::asn::asnTag] can be used to create a tag value. The [arg tagnumber] gives the number of the tag, while
the [arg class] gives one of the classes (UNIVERSAL,CONTEXT,APPLICATION or PRIVATE). The class may be abbreviated to just the first letter (U,C,A,P),
default is UNIVERSAL.
The [arg tagstyle] is either C for Constructed encoding, or P for primitve encoding. It defaults to P. You can also use 1 instead of C and
0 instead of P for direct use of the values returned by [cmd ::asn::asnPeekTag].

[call [cmd ::asn::asnRetag] [arg data_var] [arg newTag]]

Replaces the tag in front of the data in [arg data_var] with [arg newTag]. The new Tag can be created using the [cmd ::asn::asnTag] command.
