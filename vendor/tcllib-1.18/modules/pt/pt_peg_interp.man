This package provides a class whose instances are Packrat parsers
configurable with a parsing expression grammar. The grammar is
executed directly, i.e. interpreted, with the underlying runtime
provided by the package [package pt::rde], basing everything on the
PARAM.

[para]

Like the supporting runtime this package resides in the Execution
section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools.
[para][image arch_core_transform][para]

[para]

The interpreted grammar is copied from an instance of [package \
pt::peg::container], or anything providing the same API, like the
container classes created by [package pt::peg::to::container] or the
associated export plugin [package pt::peg::export::container].

[subsection {Class API}]

The package exports the API described here.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::pt::peg::interp] [arg objectName] [arg grammar]]

The command creates a new parser object and returns the fully
qualified name of the object command as its result. The API of this
object command is described in the section [sectref {Object API}]. It
may be used to invoke various operations on the object.

[para]

This new parser is configured for the execution of an empty PEG. To
configure the object for any other PEG use the method [method use] of
the [sectref {Object API}].

[list_end]

[subsection {Object API}]

All objects created by this package provide the following methods.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [arg objectName] [method use] [arg grammar]]

This method configures the grammar interpreter / parser for the
execution of the PEG stored in [arg grammar], an object which is
API-compatible to instances of [package pt::peg::container]. The
parser copies the relevant information of the grammar, and does
[emph not] take ownership of the object.

[para]

The information of any previously used grammar is overwritten.

[para]

The result of the method the empty string.
