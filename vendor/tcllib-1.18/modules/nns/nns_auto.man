Please read the document [term {Name service facility, introduction}]
first.

[para]

This package provides the [emph exact] same API as is provided by
package [package nameserv], i.e. the regular name service client. It
differs from the former by taking measures to ensure that longer-lived
data, i.e. bound names, continuous and unfullfilled async searches,
survive the loss of the connection to the name server as much as is
possible.

[para]

This means that the bound names and continuous and unfullfilled async
searches are remembered client-side and automatically re-entered into
the server when the connection comes back after its loss. For bound
names there is one important limitation to such restoration: It is
possible that a name of this client was bound by a different client
while the connection was gone. Such names are fully lost, and the best
the package can and will do is to inform the user of this.

[section API]

The user-visible API is mainly identical to the API of [package nameserv]
and is therefore not described here. Please read the documentation of
[package nameserv].

[para]

The differences are explained below, in the sections [sectref OPTIONS] and
[sectref EVENTS].

[section OPTIONS]

This package supports all the options of package [package nameserv],
plus one more. The additional option allows the user to specify the
time interval between attempts to restore a lost connection.

[list_begin options]
[opt_def -delay [arg milliseconds]]

The value of this option is an integer value > 0 which specifies the
interval to wait between attempts to restore a lost connection, in
milliseconds. The default value is [const 1000], i.e. one second.

[list_end]

[section EVENTS]

This package generates all of the events of package [package nameserv],
plus two more. Both events are generated for the tag [term nameserv].

[list_begin definitions]
[def [term lost-name]]

This event is generated when a bound name is truly lost, i.e. could
not be restored after the temporary loss of the connection to the name
server. It indicates that a different client took ownership of the
name while this client was out of contact.

[para]

The detail information of the event will be a Tcl dictionary
containing two keys, [const name], and [const data]. Their values hold
all the information about the lost name.

[def [term re-connection]]

This event is generated when the connection to the server is
restored. The remembered data has been restored when the event is
posted.

[para]

The event has no detail information.

[list_end]

[section DESIGN]

The package is implemented on top of the regular nameservice client,
i.e. package [package nameserv]. It detects the loss of the
connection by listening for [term lost-connection] events, on the tag
[term nameserv].

[para]

It reacts to such events by starting a periodic timer and trying to
reconnect to the server whenver this timer triggers. On success the
timer is canceled, a [term re-connection] event generated, and the
package proceeds to re-enter the remembered bound names and continuous
searches.

[para]

Another loss of the connection, be it during or after re-entering the
remembered information simply restarts the timer and subsequent
reconnection attempts.
