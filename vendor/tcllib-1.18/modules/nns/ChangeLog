	* ../../apps/nns: Switched to use of nameserv::auto to handle the
	* ../../apps/nnslog: loss and restoration of the server
	  automatically. Got rid of the colorization frills.

	* server.tcl (::nameserv::server::bind): Small extension of log
	* pkgIndex.tcl: output for failure case of bind. Added log output 
	* nns_server.man: to trace searches. Bumped package version to 0.3.2.

	* nns_auto.tcl: Refactored the bind and restore code, put the
	* nns_auto.man: commonalities into shared commands. Extended the
	* pkgIndex.tcl: API to become a full drop-in replacement for
	  'nameserv', just with the persistence feature. Extended the
	  persistence to continuous and unfulfilled async searches. Now
	  exporting the API commands. Bumped package version to 0.3.

	* nns.tcl: Factored the argument processing for searches into a
	* pkgIndex.tcl: separate command. Pseudo-public. Undocumented, but
	* nns_client.man: can be used by other nameserver packages. Fixed
	  leak when encountering a missing name server during creation of
	  a continuous or async search. Fixed async destruction of a
	  continous search from receiver object. Now exporting the API
	  commands. Bumped package version to 0.4.

	* nns.tcl (::nameserv::configure): wrong#args in the code
	* pkgIndex.tcl: handling the various options. Bumped client

	* nns_server.man: to 0.2.1. Also general documentation work.

	* ../../apps/nnsd.man: the options -host and -port. Reworked
	  the descriptiond of the applications a bit.

	* ../../apps/nnslog: New application and its documentation, a
	* ../../apps/nnslog.man: stripped down form of 'nns search
	  -continuous *' with different output (log of events).

2008-04-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* nns.tcl (::nameserv::configure): Fixed [Bug 1954771], bringing

	  and fix. Bumped version to 0.3.1.

	* nns_auto.man: applications in the module. All other documents now
	* nns_client.man: refer back to the introduction. Also clarified
	* nns_common.man: the relationship to DNS, which is none, plus
	* nns_protocol.man: reference to the Tcllib packages which do
	* nns_server.man: handle DNS. Pointed applications out as examples
	* ../../apps/nnsd.man: of use for the packages.
	* ../../apps/nns.man:

2008-04-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

2007-05-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	  Initial commit. TODO: Documentation for client and server, ditto
	  testsuites, are needed. Only the trivial code shared by both is
	  documented and tested. Manual testing has been done however,
	  using the nns* applications, see apps/
