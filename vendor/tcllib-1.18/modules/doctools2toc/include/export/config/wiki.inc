[section {Wiki markup}]

The basic syntax of the wiki markup generated by this plugin are
described at [uri http://wiki.tcl.tk/14].

[para]

The plugin goes beyond the classic markup to generate proper headers
and indenting.


[section Configuration]

The wiki export plugin recognizes the following configuration
variables and changes its behaviour as they specify.

[list_begin arguments]

[arg_def dictionary map]

This standard configuration variable contains a dictionary mapping
from the (symbolic) document ids in reference entries to the actual
filenames and/or urls to be used in the output.

[para]

Document ids without a mapping are used unchanged.

[list_end]

[emph Note] that this plugin ignores the standard configuration
variables [var user], [var file] and [var format], and their values.
