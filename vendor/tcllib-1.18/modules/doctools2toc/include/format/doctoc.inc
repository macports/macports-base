[section {[doctoc] notation of tables of contents}]

The doctoc format for tables of contents, also called the
[term {doctoc markup language}], is too large to be covered in single
section.

The interested reader should start with the document

[list_begin enum]
[enum]	[manpage {doctoc language introduction}]
[list_end]

and then proceed from there to the formal specifications, i.e. the
documents

[list_begin enum]
[enum]	[manpage {doctoc language syntax}] and
[enum]	[manpage {doctoc language command reference}].
[list_end]

to get a thorough understanding of the language.
