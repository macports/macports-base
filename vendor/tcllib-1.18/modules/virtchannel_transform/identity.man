[description]
[para]

The [package tcl::transform::identity] package provides a command
creating an identity channel transformation, which does nothing but
pass the read and written bytes through it unchanged. Not really
useful in an application, however as the prototypical observer
transformation its code is a useful starting point for any other
observers people may wish to write.

[para] The transformations in this module which derived from
identity's code are
[package tcl::transform::adler32],
[package tcl::transform::counter],
[package tcl::transform::crc32], and
[package tcl::transform::observe].

[para] The internal [package TclOO] class implementing the transform
handler is a sub-class of the [package tcl::transform::core]
framework.
