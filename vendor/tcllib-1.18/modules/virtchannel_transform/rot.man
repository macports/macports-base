[para]

The [package tcl::transform::rot] package provides a command creating
a channel transformation which performs primitive encryption (on
writing) and decryption (on reading) on the alphabetic characters. The
algorithm is the Caesar-cipher, a specific variant of which is rot13.

[para] A related transformations in this module is
[package tcl::transform::otp].

[para] The internal [package TclOO] class implementing the transform
handler is a sub-class of the [package tcl::transform::core]
framework.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::tcl::transform::rot] [arg chan] [arg key]]

This command creates a rot encryption transformation on top of the
channel [arg chan] and returns its handle.

[para] The "[arg key]" specifies how far characters are rotated in the
alphabet, and is wrapped to the range "0...25".

[para] Note that this transformation affects only bytes in the ranges
ASCII 65...90, and 97...122, i.e. the upper- and lower-case alphabetic
characters, i.e. "A...Z" and "a...z". All other bytes are passed
through unchanged.
