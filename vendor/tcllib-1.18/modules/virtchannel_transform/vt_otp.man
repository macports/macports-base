[para]

The [package tcl::transform::otp] package provides a command creating
a channel transformation which uses externally provided one-time pads
to perform encryption (on writing) and decryption (on reading).

[para] A related transformations in this module is
[package tcl::transform::rot].

[para] The internal [package TclOO] class implementing the transform
handler is a sub-class of the [package tcl::transform::core]
framework.

[call [cmd ::tcl::transform::otp] [arg chan] [arg keychanw] [arg keychanr]]

This command creates a one-time pad based encryption transformation on
top of the channel [arg chan] and returns its handle.

[para] The two channels [arg keychanw] and [arg keychanr] contain the
one-time pads for the write and read directions, respectively. Their
contents are reads and xored with the bytes written to and read from
the channel.
