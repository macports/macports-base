This package provides implementations of standard unix utilities.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::fileutil::lexnormalize] [arg path]]

This command performs purely lexical normalization on the [arg path] and returns
the changed path as its result. Symbolic links in the path are [emph not] resolved.

[para]
Examples:
[example {
    fileutil::lexnormalize /foo/./bar
    => /foo/bar

    fileutil::lexnormalize /foo/../bar
    => /bar
}]

[call [cmd ::fileutil::fullnormalize] [arg path]]

This command resolves all symbolic links in the [arg path] and returns
the changed path as its result.

In contrast to the builtin [cmd {file normalize}] this command
resolves a symbolic link in the last element of the path as well.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::test] [arg path] [arg codes] [opt [arg msgvar]] [opt [arg label]]]

A command for the testing of several properties of a [arg path]. The
properties to test for are specified in [arg codes], either as a list
of keywords describing the properties, or as a string where each
letter is a shorthand for a property to test. The recognized keywords,
shorthands, and associated properties are shown in the list below. The
tests are executed in the order given to the command.

[para]

The result of the command is a boolean value. It will be true if and
only if the [arg path] passes all the specified tests.

In the case of the [arg path] not passing one or more test the first
failing test will leave a message in the variable referenced by

[arg msgvar], if such is specified. The message will be prefixed with
[arg label], if it is specified.

[emph Note] that the variabled referenced by [arg msgvar] is not touched at
all if all the tests pass.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::cat] ([opt [arg options]] [arg file])...]

A tcl implementation of the UNIX [syscmd cat] command.  Returns the
contents of the specified file(s). The arguments are files to read,
with interspersed options configuring the process. If there are
problems reading any of the files, an error will occur, and no data
will be returned.

[para]

The options accepted are [option -encoding], [option -translation],
[option -eofchar], and [option --]. With the exception of the last all
options take a single value as argument, as specified by the tcl
builtin command [cmd fconfigure]. The [option --] has to be used to
terminate option processing before a file if that file's name begins
with a dash.

[para]

Each file can have its own set of options coming before it, and for
anything not specified directly the defaults are inherited from the
options of the previous file. The first file inherits the system
default for unspecified options.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::writeFile] [opt [arg options]] [arg file] [arg data]]

The command replaces the current contents of the specified [arg file]
with [arg data], with the process configured by the options. The
command accepts the same options as [cmd ::fileutil::cat]. The
specification of a non-existent file is legal and causes the command
to create the file (and all required but missing directories).

[call [cmd ::fileutil::appendToFile] [opt [arg options]] [arg file] [arg data]]

This command is like [cmd ::fileutil::writeFile], except that the
previous contents of [arg file] are not replaced, but appended to. The
command accepts the same options as [cmd ::fileutil::cat]

[call [cmd ::fileutil::insertIntoFile] [opt [arg options]] [arg file] [arg at] [arg data]]

This comment is similar to [cmd ::fileutil::appendToFile], except that
the new data is not appended at the end, but inserted at a specified
location within the file. In further contrast this command has to be
given the path to an existing file. It will not create a missing file,
but throw an error instead.

[para]

The specified location [arg at] has to be an integer number in the
range [const 0] ... [lb]file size [arg file][rb]. [const 0] will cause
insertion of the new data before the first character of the existing
content, whereas [lb]file size [arg file][rb] causes insertion after
the last character of the existing content, i.e. appending.

[para]

The command accepts the same options as [cmd ::fileutil::cat].

[call [cmd ::fileutil::removeFromFile] [opt [arg options]] [arg file] [arg at] [arg n]]

This command is the complement to [cmd ::fileutil::insertIntoFile], removing [arg n] characters from the [arg file], starting at location [arg at].

The specified location [arg at] has to be an integer number in the
range [const 0] ... [lb]file size [arg file][rb] - [arg n]. [const 0]
will cause the removal of the new data to start with the first
character of the existing content,

whereas [lb]file size [arg file][rb] - [arg n] causes the removal of
the tail of the existing content, i.e. the truncation of the file.

[para]

The command accepts the same options as [cmd ::fileutil::cat].

[call [cmd ::fileutil::replaceInFile] [opt [arg options]] [arg file] [arg at] [arg n] [arg data]]

This command is a combination of [cmd ::fileutil::removeFromFile] and
[cmd ::fileutil::insertIntoFile]. It first removes the part of the
contents specified by the arguments [arg at] and [arg n], and then
inserts [arg data] at the given location, effectively replacing the
removed by content with [arg data].

All constraints imposed on [arg at] and [arg n] by
[cmd ::fileutil::removeFromFile] and [cmd ::fileutil::insertIntoFile]
are obeyed.

[para]

The command accepts the same options as [cmd ::fileutil::cat].

[call [cmd ::fileutil::updateInPlace] [opt [arg options]] [arg file] [arg cmd]]

This command can be seen as the generic core functionality of
[cmd ::fileutil::replaceInFile].

It first reads the contents of the specified [arg file], then runs the
command prefix [arg cmd] with that data appended to it, and at last
writes the result of that invokation back as the new contents of the
file.

[para]

If the executed command throws an error the [arg file] is not changed.

[para]

The command accepts the same options as [cmd ::fileutil::cat].

[call [cmd ::fileutil::fileType] [arg filename]]

An implementation of the UNIX [syscmd file] command, which uses
various heuristics to guess the type of a file.  Returns a list
specifying as much type information as can be determined about the
file, from most general (eg, "binary" or "text") to most specific (eg,
"gif").  For example, the return value for a GIF file would be "binary
graphic gif".  The command will detect the following types of files:
directory, empty, binary, text, script (with interpreter), executable
elf, executable dos, executable ne, executable pe, graphic gif, graphic
jpeg, graphic png, graphic tiff, graphic bitmap, html, xml (with doctype
if available), message pgp, binary pdf, text ps, text eps, binary
gravity_wave_data_frame, compressed bzip, compressed gzip, compressed
zip, compressed tar, audio wave, audio mpeg, and link. It further
detects doctools, doctoc, and docidx documentation files, and
tklib diagrams.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::find] [opt "[arg basedir] [opt [arg filtercmd]]"]]

An implementation of the unix command [syscmd find]. Adapted from the
Tcler's Wiki. Takes at most two arguments, the path to the directory
to start searching from and a command to use to evaluate interest in
each file. The path defaults to [file .], i.e. the current
directory. The command defaults to the empty string, which means that
all files are of interest. The command takes care [emph not] to
lose itself in infinite loops upon encountering circular link
structures. The result of the command is a list containing the paths
to the interesting files.

[para]

The [arg filtercmd], if specified, is interpreted as a command prefix
and one argument is added to it, the name of the file or directory
find is currently looking at. Note that this name is [emph not] fully
qualified. It has to be joined it with the result of [cmd pwd] to get
an absolute filename.

[para]

The result of [arg filtercmd] is a boolean value that indicates if the
current file should be included in the list of interesting files.

[para]
Example:
[para]
[example {
    # find .tcl files
    package require fileutil
    proc is_tcl {name} {return [string match *.tcl $name]}
    set tcl_files [fileutil::find . is_tcl]
}]

[call [cmd ::fileutil::findByPattern] [arg basedir] \
     [opt [option -regexp]|[option -glob]] [opt [option --]] \
     [arg patterns]]

This command is based upon the [package TclX] command

[cmd recursive_glob], except that it doesn't allow recursion over more
than one directory at a time. It uses [cmd ::fileutil::find]
internally and is thus able to and does follow symbolic links,
something the [package TclX] command does not do. First argument is
the directory to start the search in, second argument is a list of
[arg patterns]. The command returns a list of all files reachable
through [arg basedir] whose names match at least one of the
patterns. The options before the pattern-list determine the style of
matching, either regexp or glob. glob-style matching is the default if
no options are given. Usage of the option [option --] stops option
processing. This allows the use of a leading '-' in the patterns.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::foreachLine] [arg {var filename cmd}]]

The command reads the file [arg filename] and executes the script

[arg cmd] for every line in the file. During the execution of the
script the variable [arg var] is set to the contents of the current
line. The return value of this command is the result of the last
invocation of the script [arg cmd] or the empty string if the file was
empty.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::grep] [arg pattern] [opt [arg files]]]

Implementation of [syscmd grep]. Adapted from the Tcler's Wiki. The
first argument defines the [arg pattern] to search for. This is
followed by a list of [arg files] to search through. The list is
optional and [const stdin] will be used if it is missing. The result
of the procedures is a list containing the matches. Each match is a
single element of the list and contains filename, number and contents
of the matching line, separated by a colons.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::install] [opt "[option -m] [arg "mode"]"] [arg source] [arg destination]]

The [cmd install] command is similar in functionality to the [syscmd install]
command found on many unix systems, or the shell script
distributed with many source distributions (unix/install-sh in the Tcl
sources, for example).  It copies [arg source], which can be either a
file or directory to [arg destination], which should be a directory,
unless [arg source] is also a single file.  The [opt -m] option lets
the user specify a unix-style mode (either octal or symbolic - see
[cmd {file attributes}].

[call [cmd ::fileutil::stripN] [arg path] [arg n]]

Removes the first [arg n] elements from the specified [arg path] and
returns the modified path. If [arg n] is greater than the number of
components in [arg path] an empty string is returned. The number of
components in a given path may be determined by performing
[cmd llength] on the list returned by [cmd {file split}].

[call [cmd ::fileutil::stripPwd] [arg path]]

If, and only if the [arg path] is inside of the directory returned by
[lb][cmd pwd][rb] (or the current working directory itself) it is made
relative to that directory. In other words, the current working
directory is stripped from the [arg path].  The possibly modified path
is returned as the result of the command. If the current working
directory itself was specified for [arg path] the result is the string
"[const .]".

[call [cmd ::fileutil::stripPath] [arg prefix] [arg path]]

If, and only of the [arg path] is inside of the directory

[file prefix] (or the prefix directory itself) it is made relative to
that directory. In other words, the prefix directory is stripped from
the [arg path]. The possibly modified path is returned as the result
of the command.

If the prefix directory itself was specified for [arg path] the result
is the string "[const .]".

[call [cmd ::fileutil::jail] [arg jail] [arg path]]

This command ensures that the [arg path] is not escaping the directory
[arg jail]. It always returns an absolute path derived from [arg path]
which is within [arg jail].

[para]

If [arg path] is an absolute path and already within [arg jail] it is
returned unmodified.

[para]

An absolute path outside of [arg jail] is stripped of its root element
and then put into the [arg jail] by prefixing it with it. The same
happens if [arg path] is relative, except that nothing is stripped of
it. Before adding the [arg jail] prefix the [arg path] is lexically
normalized to prevent the caller from using [const ..] segments in
[arg path] to escape the jail.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::touch] [opt [option -a]] [opt [option -c]] [opt [option -m]] [opt "[option -r] [arg ref_file]"] [opt "[option -t] [arg time]"] [arg filename] [opt [arg ...]]]

Implementation of [syscmd touch]. Alter the atime and mtime of the
specified files. If [option -c], do not create files if they do not
already exist. If [option -r], use the atime and mtime from

[arg ref_file]. If [option -t], use the integer clock value

[arg time]. It is illegal to specify both [option -r] and

[option -t]. If [option -a], only change the atime. If [option -m],
only change the mtime.

[para]
[emph {This command is not available for Tcl versions less than 8.3.}]

[call [cmd ::fileutil::tempdir]]

The command returns the path of a directory where the caller can
place temporary files, such as [file /tmp] on Unix systems. The
algorithm we use to find the correct directory is as follows:

[list_begin enumerated]

[enum]
The directory set by an invokation of [cmd ::fileutil::tempdir] with
an argument. If this is present it is tried exclusively and none of
the following item are tried.

[enum]
The directory named in the TMPDIR environment variable.

[enum]
The directory named in the TEMP environment variable.

[enum]
The directory named in the TMP environment variable.

[enum]
A platform specific location:

[list_begin definitions]
[def {Windows}]

[file "C:\\TEMP"], [file "C:\\TMP"], [file "\\TEMP"],
and [file "\\TMP"] are tried in that order.

[def {(classic) Macintosh}]

The TRASH_FOLDER environment variable is used.  This is most likely
not correct.

[def {Unix}]

The directories [file /tmp], [file /var/tmp], and [file /usr/tmp] are
tried in that order.

[list_end]
[list_end]
[para]

The algorithm utilized is mainly that used in the Python standard
library. The exception is the first item, the ability to have the
search overridden by a user-specified directory.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::tempdir] [arg path]]

In this mode the command sets the [arg path] as the first and only
directory to try as a temp. directory. See the previous item for the
use of the set directory. The command returns the empty string.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::tempdirReset]]

Invoking this command clears the information set by the
last call of [lb][cmd ::fileutil::tempdir] [arg path][rb].
See the last item too.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::tempfile] [opt [arg prefix]]]

The command generates a temporary file name suitable for writing to,
and the associated file.  The file name will be unique, and the file
will be writable and contained in the appropriate system specific temp
directory. The name of the file will be returned as the result of the
command.

[para]

The code was taken from [uri http://wiki.tcl.tk/772], attributed to
Igor Volobouev and anon.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::maketempdir] \
	[opt "[option -prefix] [arg str]"] \
	[opt "[option -suffix] [arg str]"] \
	[opt "[option -dir] [arg str]"]]

The command generates a temporary directory suitable for writing to.
The directory name will be unique, and the directory will be writable
and contained in the appropriate system specific temp directory. The
name of the directory will be returned as the result of the command.

[para] The three options can used to tweak the behaviour of the command:

[list_begin options]
[opt_def -prefix str] The initial, fixed part of the directory name. Defaults to [const tmp] if not specified.
[opt_def -suffix str] The fixed tail of the directory. Defaults to the empty string if not specified.
[opt_def -dir    str] The directory to place the new directory into. Defaults to the result of [cmd fileutil::tempdir] if not specified.
[list_end]

[para]The initial code for this was supplied by [uri mailto:aplicacionamedida@gmail.com {Miguel Martinez Lopez}].

[call [cmd ::fileutil::relative] [arg base] [arg dst]]

This command takes two directory paths, both either absolute or relative
and computes the path of [arg dst] relative to [arg base]. This relative
path is returned as the result of the command. As implied in the previous
sentence, the command is not able to compute this relationship between the
arguments if one of the paths is absolute and the other relative.

[para]

[emph Note:] The processing done by this command is purely lexical.
Symbolic links are [emph not] taken into account.

[call [cmd ::fileutil::relativeUrl] [arg base] [arg dst]]

This command takes two file paths, both either absolute or relative
and computes the path of [arg dst] relative to [arg base], as seen
from inside of the [arg base]. This is the algorithm how a browser
resolves a relative link found in the currently shown file.

[para]

The computed relative path is returned as the result of the command.
As implied in the previous sentence, the command is not able to compute
this relationship between the arguments if one of the paths is absolute
and the other relative.

[para]

[emph Note:] The processing done by this command is purely lexical.
Symbolic links are [emph not] taken into account.

[section {Warnings and Incompatibilities}]

[list_begin definitions]

[def [const 1.14.9]]
In this version [cmd fileutil::find]'s broken system for handling
symlinks was replaced with one working correctly and properly
enumerating all the legal non-cyclic paths under a base directory.

[para] While correct this means that certain pathological directory
hierarchies with cross-linked sym-links will now take about O(n**2)
time to enumerate whereas the original broken code managed O(n) due to
its brokenness.

[para] A concrete example and extreme case is the [file /sys]
hierarchy under Linux where some hundred devices exist under both
[file /sys/devices] and [file /sys/class] with the two sub-hierarchies
linking to the other, generating millions of legal paths to enumerate.
The structure, reduced to three devices, roughly looks like

[include include/cross-index.inc]

[para] The command [cmd fileutil::find] currently has no way to escape
this. When having to handle such a pathological hierarchy It is
recommended to switch to package [package fileutil::traverse] and the
same-named command it provides, and then use the [option -prefilter]
option to prevent the traverser from following symbolic links, like so:

[include include/cross-index-trav.inc]

[list_end]

[vset CATEGORY fileutil]
[include ../doctools2base/include/feedback.inc]
[manpage_end]
