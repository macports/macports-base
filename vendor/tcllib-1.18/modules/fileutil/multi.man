[description]
[para]

This package provides a single command to perform actions on multiple
files selected by glob patterns. It is a thin layer over the package
[package fileutil::multi::op] which provides objects for the
same. This package simply creates a single such object and directs all
file commands to it.

[para]

At the core is a domain specific language allowing the easy
specification of multi-file copy and/or move and/or deletion
operations. Alternate names would be scatter/gather processor, or
maybe even assembler.

For the detailed specification of this language, and examples, please
see the documention for the package [package fileutil::multi::op].

[section {PUBLIC API}]

The main command of the package is:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::fileutil::multi] [opt [arg word]...]]

This command interprets the specified words as file commands to
execute. See the section [sectref-external {FILE API}] of the
documentation for the package [package fileutil::multi::op] for
the set of acceptable commands, their syntax, and semantics.

[para]

The result of the command is the result generated by the last file
command it executed.
