[description]
[para]

This package provides the plugin manager central to the [syscmd page]
application. It manages the various reader, writer, configuration, and
transformation plugins which actually process the text (read,
transform, and write).

[para]

All plugins are loaded into slave interpreters specially prepared for
them. While implemented using packages they need this special
environment and are not usable in a plain interpreter, like
tclsh. Because of that they are only described in general terms in
section [sectref {PREDEFINED PLUGINS}], and not documented as regular
packages. It is expected that they follow the APIs specified in the
sections

[list_begin enum]
[enum] [sectref {CONFIG PLUGIN API}]
[enum] [sectref {READER PLUGIN API}]
[enum] [sectref {WRITER PLUGIN API}]
[enum] [sectref {TRANSFORM PLUGIN API}]
[list_end]

as per their type.

[section API]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::reportvia] [arg cmd]]

This command defines the callback command used by

[cmd ::page::pluginmgr::report] (see below) to report input errors and
warnings. The default is to write such reports to the standard error
channel.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::report] [arg level] [arg text] [opt "[arg from] [opt [arg to]]"]]

This command is used to report input errors and warnings. By default
such reports are written to the standard error. This can be changed by
setting a user-specific callback command with
[cmd ::page::pluginmgr::reportvia] (see above).

[para]

The arguments [arg level] and [arg text] specify both the importance
of the message, and the message itself. For the former see the package
[package logger] for the allowed values.

[para]

The optional argument [arg from] and [arg to] can be used by the
caller to indicate the location (or range) in the input where the
reported problem occured. Each is a list containing two elements, the
line and the column in the input, in this order.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::log] [arg cmd]]

This command defines a log callback command to be used by loaded
plugins for the reporting of internal errors, warnings, and general
information. Specifying the empty string as callback disables logging.

[para]

Note: The [arg cmd] has to be created by the [package logger] package,
or follow the same API as such.

[para]

The command returns the empty string as its result.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::configuration] [arg name]]

This command loads the named configuration plugin, retrieves the
options encoded in it, and then immediately unloads it again.

[para]

If the [arg name] is the path to a file, then this files will be tried
to be loaded as a plugin first, and, if that fails, opened and its
contents read as a list of options and their arguments, separated by
spaces, tabs and newlines, possibly quotes with single and double
quotes.

[para]

See section [sectref {CONFIG PLUGIN API}] for the API expected of
configuration plugins.

[para]

The result of the command is the list of options retrieved.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::reader] [arg name]]

This command loads the named reader plugin and initializes it. The
result of the command is a list of options the plugin understands.

[para]

Only a single reader plugin can be loaded. Loading another reader
plugin causes the previously loaded reader plugin to be de-initialized
and unloaded.

[para]

See section [sectref {READER PLUGIN API}] for the API expected of
reader plugins.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::rconfigure] [arg dict]]

This commands configures the loaded reader plugin. The options and
their values are provided as a Tcl dictionary. The result of the
command is the empty string.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::rtimeable]]

This commands checks if the loaded reader plugin is able to collect
timing statistics. The result of the command is a boolean flag. The
result is [const true] if the plugin can be timed, and [const false]
otherwise.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::rtime]]

This command activates the collection of timing statistics in the
loaded reader plugin.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::rgettime]]

This command retrieves the collected timing statistics of the loaded
reader plugin after it was executed.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::rhelp]]

This command retrieves the help string of the loaded reader
plugin. This is expected to be in [term doctools] format.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::rlabel]]

This command retrieves the human-readable name of the loaded reader
plugin.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::read] [arg read] [arg eof] [opt [arg complete]]]

This command invokes the loaded reader plugin to process the input,
and returns the results of the plugin as its own result. The input is
accessible through the callback commands [arg read], and [arg eof]. The
optional [arg done] can be used to intrecept when the plugin has
completed its processing. All arguments are command prefixes.

[para]

The plugin will invoke the various callbacks in the following
situations:

[list_begin definitions]
[call [arg read] [arg num]]
is invoked whenever input to process is needed, with the number of
characters/bytes it asks for. The result is expected to be the input
the plugin is in need of.

[call [arg eof]]
is invoked by the plugin to check if the input has reached the of the
stream. The result is expected to be a boolean flag, [const true] when
the input has hit EOF, and [const false] otherwise.

[call [arg done]]
is invoked when the plugin has completed the processing of the input.

[list_end]

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::writer] [arg name]]

This command loads the named writer plugin and initializes it. The
result of the command is a list of options the plugin understands.

[para]

plugin causes the previously loaded reader plugin to be de-initialized
and unloaded.

[para]

See section [sectref {WRITER PLUGIN API}] for the API expected of
writer plugins.

their values are provided as a Tcl dictionary. The result of the
command is the empty string.

execution times. The result of the command is a boolean flag. The
result is [const true] if the plugin can be timed, and [const false]
otherwise.

This command activates the collection of timing statistics in the
loaded writer plugin.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::wgettime]]

This command retrieves the collected timing statistics of the loaded
writer plugin after it was executed.

This command retrieves the human-readable name of the loaded writer
plugin.

given the [arg data] to generate the outpout from, and the Tcl handle
[arg chan] of the channel to write the generated output to. The
command returns th empty string as its result.

[call [cmd ::page::pluginmgr::transform] [arg name]]

This command loads the named transformation plugin and initializes
it. The result of the command is a 2-element list containing the
plugin id and a list of options the plugin understands, in this order.

transformation plugins.

options and their values are provided as a Tcl dictionary. The result
of the command is the empty string.

	Describe the predefined features.

[section FEATURES]

The plugin manager currently checks the plugins for only one feature,
[const timeable]. A plugin supporting this feature is assumed to be
able to collect timing statistics on request.
