This package provides a few utility commands to convert characters
into various forms.

[section API]

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::page::util::quote::unquote] [arg char]]

A character, as stored in an abstract syntax tree by a PEG processor
(See the packages [package grammar::peg::interpreter],
[package grammar::me], and their relations), i.e. in some quoted form,
is converted into the equivalent Tcl character. The character is returned
as the result of the command.

[call [cmd ::page::util::quote::quote'tcl] [arg char]]

This command takes a Tcl character (internal representation) and
converts it into a string which is accepted by the Tcl parser, will
regenerate the character in question and is 7bit ASCII. The string is
returned as the result of this command.

[call [cmd ::page::util::quote::quote'tclstr] [arg char]]

This command takes a Tcl character (internal representation) and
converts it into a string which is accepted by the Tcl parser and will
generate a human readable representation of the character in question.
The string is returned as the result of this command.

[para]

The string does not use any unprintable characters. It may use
backslash-quoting. High UTF characters are quoted to avoid problems
with the still prevalent ascii terminals. It is assumed that the
string will be used in a double-quoted environment.

[call [cmd ::page::util::quote::quote'tclcom] [arg char]]

This command takes a Tcl character (internal representation) and
converts it into a string which is accepted by the Tcl parser when
used within a Tcl comment. The string is returned as the result of
this command.
