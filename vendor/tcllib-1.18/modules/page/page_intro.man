[para]

[term page] (short for [emph {parser generator}]) stands for a set of
related packages which help in the construction of parser generators,
and other utilities doing text processing.

[para]

They are mainly geared towards supporting the Tcllib application
[syscmd page], with the package [package page::pluginmgr] in a central
role as the plugin management for the application. The other packages
are performing low-level text processing and utility tasks geared
towards parser generation and mainly accessed by [syscmd page] through
plugins.

[para]

The packages implementing the plugins are not documented as regular
packages, as they cannot be loaded into a general interpreter, like
tclsh, without extensive preparation of the interpreter. Preparation
which is done for them by the plugin manager.
