[description]
[para]
This package deals with polynomial functions of one variable:

[list_begin itemized]
[item]
the basic arithmetic operations are extended to polynomials
[item]
computing the derivatives and primitives of these functions
[item]
evaluation through a general procedure or via specific procedures)
[list_end]

[section "PROCEDURES"]

The package defines the following public procedures:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::polynomial] [arg coeffs]]

Return an (encoded) list that defines the polynomial. A polynomial
[example {
   f(x) = a + b.x + c.x**2 + d.x**3
}]
can be defined via:
[example {
   set f [::math::polynomials::polynomial [list $a $b $c $d]
}]

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list coeffs] Coefficients of the polynomial (in ascending
order)
[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::polynCmd] [arg coeffs]]

Create a new procedure that evaluates the polynomial. The name of the
polynomial is automatically generated. Useful if you need to evualuate
the polynomial many times, as the procedure consists of a single
[lb]expr[rb] command.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list coeffs] Coefficients of the polynomial (in ascending
order) or the polynomial definition returned by the [emph polynomial]
command.
[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::evalPolyn] [arg polynomial] [arg x]]

Evaluate the polynomial at x.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polynomial] The polynomial's definition (as returned by
the polynomial command).
order)

[arg_def float x] The coordinate at which to evaluate the polynomial

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::addPolyn] [arg polyn1] [arg polyn2]]

Return a new polynomial which is the sum of the two others.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polyn1] The first polynomial operand

[arg_def list polyn2] The second polynomial operand

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::subPolyn] [arg polyn1] [arg polyn2]]

Return a new polynomial which is the difference of the two others.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polyn1] The first polynomial operand

[arg_def list polyn2] The second polynomial operand

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::multPolyn] [arg polyn1] [arg polyn2]]

Return a new polynomial which is the product of the two others. If one
of the arguments is a scalar value, the other polynomial is simply
scaled.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polyn1] The first polynomial operand or a scalar

[arg_def list polyn2] The second polynomial operand or a scalar

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::divPolyn] [arg polyn1] [arg polyn2]]

Divide the first polynomial by the second polynomial and return the
result. The remainder is dropped

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polyn1] The first polynomial operand

[arg_def list polyn2] The second polynomial operand

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::remainderPolyn] [arg polyn1] [arg polyn2]]

Divide the first polynomial by the second polynomial and return the
remainder.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polyn1] The first polynomial operand

[arg_def list polyn2] The second polynomial operand

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::derivPolyn] [arg polyn]]

Differentiate the polynomial and return the result.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polyn] The polynomial to be differentiated

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::primitivePolyn] [arg polyn]]

Integrate the polynomial and return the result. The integration
constant is set to zero.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polyn] The polynomial to be integrated

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::degreePolyn] [arg polyn]]

Return the degree of the polynomial.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polyn] The polynomial to be examined

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::coeffPolyn] [arg polyn] [arg index]]

Return the coefficient of the term of the index'th degree of the
polynomial.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polyn] The polynomial to be examined
[arg_def int  index] The degree of the term

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::polynomials::allCoeffsPolyn] [arg polyn]]

Return the coefficients of the polynomial (in ascending order).

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list polyn] The polynomial in question

[list_end]

[list_end]

[section "REMARKS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION"]

The implementation for evaluating the polynomials at some point uses
Horn's rule, which guarantees numerical stability and a minimum of
arithmetic operations.

To recognise that a polynomial definition is indeed a correct
definition, it consists of a list of two elements: the keyword
"POLYNOMIAL" and the list of coefficients in descending order. The
latter makes it easier to implement Horner's rule.
