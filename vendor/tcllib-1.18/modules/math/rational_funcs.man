[description]
[para]
This package deals with rational functions of one variable:

[list_begin itemized]
[item]
the basic arithmetic operations are extended to rational functions
[item]
computing the derivatives of these functions
[item]
evaluation through a general procedure or via specific procedures)
[list_end]

[section "PROCEDURES"]

The package defines the following public procedures:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::math::rationalfunctions::rationalFunction] [arg num] [arg den]]

Return an (encoded) list that defines the rational function. A
rational function
[example {
             1 + x^3
   f(x) = ------------
          1 + 2x + x^2
}]
can be defined via:
[example {
   set f [::math::rationalfunctions::rationalFunction [list 1 0 0 1] \
             [list 1 2 1]]
}]

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list num] Coefficients of the numerator of the rational
function (in ascending order)
[para]
[arg_def list den] Coefficients of the denominator of the rational
function (in ascending order)
[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::rationalfunctions::ratioCmd] [arg num] [arg den]]

Create a new procedure that evaluates the rational function. The name of the
function is automatically generated. Useful if you need to evaluate
the function many times, as the procedure consists of a single
[lb]expr[rb] command.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list num] Coefficients of the numerator of the rational
function (in ascending order)
[para]
[arg_def list den] Coefficients of the denominator of the rational
function (in ascending order)
[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::rationalfunctions::evalRatio] [arg rational] [arg x]]

Evaluate the rational function at x.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list rational] The rational function's definition (as returned
by the rationalFunction command).
order)

[arg_def float x] The coordinate at which to evaluate the function

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::rationalfunctions::addRatio] [arg ratio1] [arg ratio2]]

Return a new rational function which is the sum of the two others.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list ratio1] The first rational function operand

[arg_def list ratio2] The second rational function operand

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::rationalfunctions::subRatio] [arg ratio1] [arg ratio2]]

Return a new rational function which is the difference of the two
others.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list ratio1] The first rational function operand

[arg_def list ratio2] The second rational function operand

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::rationalfunctions::multRatio] [arg ratio1] [arg ratio2]]

Return a new rational function which is the product of the two others.
If one of the arguments is a scalar value, the other rational function is
simply scaled.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list ratio1] The first rational function operand or a scalar

[arg_def list ratio2] The second rational function operand or a scalar

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::rationalfunctions::divRatio] [arg ratio1] [arg ratio2]]

Divide the first rational function by the second rational function and
return the result. The remainder is dropped

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list ratio1] The first rational function operand

[arg_def list ratio2] The second rational function operand

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::rationalfunctions::derivPolyn] [arg ratio]]

Differentiate the rational function and return the result.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list ratio] The rational function to be differentiated

[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::rationalfunctions::coeffsNumerator] [arg ratio]]

Return the coefficients of the numerator of the rational function.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list ratio] The rational function to be examined
[list_end]

[para]

[call [cmd ::math::rationalfunctions::coeffsDenominator] [arg ratio]]

Return the coefficients of the denominator of the rational
function.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list ratio] The rational function to be examined
[list_end]

[para]

[list_end]

[section "REMARKS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION"]

The implementation of the rational functions relies on the
math::polynomials package. For further remarks see the documentation on
that package.
