This file records outstanding actions for the math module

dd. 26 april 2015, Arjen Markus
Add:
- additional linear algebra procedures by Federico Ferri
- lognormal income library by Eric Benedict
- empirical distribution
- tukey-duckworth test



dd. 18 january 2014, Arjen Markus
test cases for kernel-density:
One test case is troublesome - uniform kernel, checking the total density


dd. 26 october 2005, Arjen Markus

qcomplex.test: extend the tests for cos/sin .. to include
               non-real results.

dd. 28 september 2005, Arjen Markus

optimize.tcl: linear programming algorithm ignores certain
              constraints (of type x > 0). Needs to be
              fixed

dd. 22 june 2004, Arjen Markus

interpolate.man: add examples
interpolate.tcl: more consistency in the calling convention
                 checks on arguments (add tests for them)
optimize.man: example of a parametrized function (also a test case!)
optimize.tcl: provide an alternative for maximum
