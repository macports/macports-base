[description]
  [para]
    [cmd ::math::roman] is a pure-Tcl library for converting between integers
    and roman numerals. It also provides utility functions for sorting and performing
    arithmetic on roman numerals.
  [para]
    This code was originally harvested from the Tcler's wiki at
    http://wiki.tcl.tk/1823 and as such is free for any use for
    any purpose. Many thanks to the ingeneous folk who devised
    these clever routines and generously contributed them to the
    Tcl community.
  [para]
    While written and tested under Tcl 8.3, I expect this library
    will work under all 8.x versions of Tcl.

[section {COMMANDS}]
  [list_begin definitions]

    [call [cmd ::math::roman::toroman] [arg i]]
      Convert an integer to roman numerals. The result is always in
      upper case. The value zero is converted to an empty string.

    [call [cmd ::math::roman::tointeger] [arg r]]
      Convert a roman numeral into an integer.

    [call [cmd ::math::roman::sort] [arg list]]
      Sort a list of roman numerals from smallest to largest.

    [call [cmd ::math::roman::expr] [arg args]]
      Evaluate an expression where the operands are all roman numerals.

  [list_end]

Of these commands both [emph toroman] and [emph tointeger] are exported
for easier use. The other two are not, as they could interfer or be
confused with existing Tcl commands.
