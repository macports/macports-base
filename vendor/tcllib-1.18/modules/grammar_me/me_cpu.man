[description]
[para]

This package provides an implementation of the ME virtual machine.

Please go and read the document [syscmd grammar::me_intro] first if
you do not know what a ME virtual machine is.

[para]

This implementation provides an object-based API and the machines are
not truly tied to Tcl. A C implementation of the same API is quite
possible.

[para]

Internally the package actually uses the value-based machine
manipulation commands as provided by the package

[package grammar::me::cpu::core] to perform its duties.

[section API]
[subsection {CLASS API}]

The package directly provides only a single command for the
construction of ME virtual machines.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::grammar::me::cpu] [arg meName] [arg matchcode]]

The command creates a new ME machine object with an associated global
Tcl command whose name is [arg meName]. This command may be used to
invoke various operations on the machine.

It has the following general form:

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd meName] [method option] [opt [arg "arg arg ..."]]]

[arg Option] and the [arg arg]s determine the exact behavior of the
command.

[list_end]
[para]

The argument [arg matchcode] contains the match instructions the
machine has to execute while parsing the input stream. Please read
section [sectref-external {MATCH CODE REPRESENTATION}] of the
documentation for the package [package grammar::me::cpu::core] for
the specification of the structure of this value.

[para]

The [arg tokmap] argument taken by the implementation provided by the
package [package grammar::me::tcl] is here hidden inside of the match
instructions and therefore not needed.

[list_end]
[para]

[subsection {OBJECT API}]

All ME virtual machine objects created by the class command specified
in section [sectref {CLASS API}] support the methods listed below.

[para]

The machines provided by this package provide methods for operation in
both push- and pull-styles. Push-style means that tokens are pushed
into the machine state when they arrive, triggering further execution
until they are consumed. In other words, this allows the machine to be
suspended and resumed at will and an arbitrary number of times, the
quasi-parallel operation of several machines, and the operation as
part of the event loop.

[list_begin definitions]
[call [arg meName] [method lc] [arg location]]

This method converts the location of a token given as offset in the
input stream into the associated line number and column index. The
result of the command is a 2-element list containing the two values,
in the order mentioned in the previous sentence.

This allows higher levels to convert the location information found in
the error status and the generated AST into more human readable data.

[para]

[emph Note] that the command is not able to convert locations which
have not been reached by the machine yet. In other words, if the
machine has read 7 tokens the command is able to convert the offsets
[const 0] to [const 6], but nothing beyond that. This also shows that
it is not possible to convert offsets which refer to locations before
the beginning of the stream.

[call [arg meName] [method tok] [opt "[arg from] [opt [arg to]]"]]

This method returns a Tcl list containing the part of the input stream
between the locations [arg from] and [arg to] (both inclusive). If
[arg to] is not specified it will default to the value of [arg from].
If [arg from] is not specified either the whole input stream is returned.

[para]

Each element of the returned list is a list of four elements, the
token, its associated lexeme, line number, and column index, in this
order.

This command places the same restrictions on its location arguments as
the method [method lc].

[call [arg meName] [method pc] [arg state]]

This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and returns
the current value of the stored program counter.

[call [arg meName] [method iseof] [arg state]]

This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and returns
the current value of the stored eof flag.

[call [arg meName] [method at] [arg state]]

This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and returns
the current location in the input stream.

[call [arg meName] [method cc] [arg state]]

This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and returns
the current token.

[call [arg meName] [method sv]]

This command returns the current semantic value [term SV] stored in
the machine. This is an abstract syntax tree as specified in the
document [syscmd grammar::me_ast], section [sectref-external {AST VALUES}].

[call [arg meName] [method ok]]

This method returns the current match status [term OK].

[call [arg meName] [method error]]

This method returns the current error status [term ER].

[call [arg meName] [method lstk] [arg state]]

This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and returns
the location stack.

[call [arg meName] [method astk] [arg state]]

This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and returns
the AST stack.

[call [arg meName] [method mstk] [arg state]]

This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and returns
the AST marker stack.

[call [arg meName] [method estk] [arg state]]

This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and returns
the error stack.

[call [arg meName] [method rstk] [arg state]]

This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and returns
the subroutine return stack.

[call [arg meName] [method nc] [arg state]]

This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and returns
the nonterminal match cache as a dictionary.

[call [arg meName] [method ast]]

This method returns the current top entry of the AST stack [term AS].

This is an abstract syntax tree as specified in the document
[syscmd grammar::me_ast], section [sectref-external {AST VALUES}].

[call [arg meName] [method halted]]

This method returns a boolean value telling the caller whether the
engine has halted execution or not. Halt means that no further
matching is possible, and the information retrieved via the other
method is final. Attempts to [method run] the engine will be ignored,
until a [method reset] is made.

[call [arg meName] [method code]]

This method returns the [arg code] information used to construct the
object. In other words, the match program executed by the machine.

[call [arg meName] [method eof]]

This method adds an end of file marker to the end of the input stream.
This signals the machine that the current contents of the input queue
are the final parts of the input and nothing will come after. Attempts
to put more characters into the queue will fail.

[call [arg meName] [method put] [arg tok] [arg lex] [arg line] [arg col]]

This method adds the token [arg tok] to the end of the input stream,
with associated lexeme data [arg lex] and [arg line]/[arg col]umn
information.

[call [arg meName] [method putstring] [arg string] [arg lvar] [arg cvar]]

This method adds each individual character in the [arg string] as a
token to the end of the input stream, from first to last. The lexemes
will be empty and the line/col information is computed based on the
characters encountered and the data in the variables [arg lvar] and
[arg cvar].

[call [arg meName] [method run] [opt [arg n]]]

This methods causes the engine to execute match instructions until
either

[list_begin itemized]
[item] [arg n] instructions have been executed, or
[item] a halt instruction was executed, or
[item]
the input queue is empty and the code is asking for more tokens to
process.
[list_end]
[para]

If no limit [arg n] was set only the last two conditions are checked
for.

[call [arg meName] [method pull] [arg nextcmd]]

This method implements pull-style operation of the machine. It causes
it to execute match instructions until either a halt instruction is
reached, or the command prefix

[arg nextcmd] ceases to deliver more tokens.

[para]

The command prefix [arg nextcmd] represents the input stream of
characters and is invoked by the machine whenever the a new character
from the stream is required. The instruction for handling this is
[term ict_advance].

The callback has to return either the empty list, or a list of 4
elements containing the token, its lexeme attribute, and its location
as line number and column index, in this order.

The empty list is the signal that the end of the input stream has been
reached. The lexeme attribute is stored in the terminal cache, but
otherwise not used by the machine.

[para]

The end of the input stream for this method does not imply that method
[method eof] is called for the machine as a whole. By avoiding this
and still asking for an explicit call of the method it is possible to
mix push- and pull-style operation during the lifetime of the machine.

[call [arg meName] [method reset]]

This method resets the machine to its initial state, discarding any
state it may have.

[call [arg meName] [method destroy]]

This method deletes the object and releases all resurces it claimed.
