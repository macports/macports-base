[description]

This document is an introduction to and overview of the basic
facilities for the parsing and/or matching of [term token]
streams. One possibility often used for the token domain are
characters.

[para]

The packages themselves all provide variants of one

[term {virtual machine}], called a [term {match engine}] (short

[term ME]), which has all the facilities needed for the matching and
parsing of a stream, and which are either controlled directly, or are
customized with a match program. The virtual machine is basically a
pushdown automaton, with additional elements for backtracking and/or
handling of semantic data and construction of abstract syntax trees
([term AST]).

[para]

Because of the high degree of similarity in the actual implementations
of the aforementioned virtual machine and the data structures they
receive and generate these common parts are specified in a separate
document which will be referenced by the documentation for packages
actually implementing it.

The relevant documents are:

[list_begin definitions]

[def [package grammar::me_vm]]

Virtual machine specification.

[def [package grammar::me_ast]]

Specification of various representations used for abstract syntax
trees.

[def [package grammar::me::util]]

Utility commands.

[def [package grammar::me::tcl]]

Singleton ME virtual machine implementation tied to Tcl for control
flow and stacks. Hardwired for pull operation. Uninteruptible during
processing.

[def [package grammar::me::cpu]]

Object-based ME virtual machine implementation with explicit control
flow, and stacks, using bytecodes. Suspend/Resumable. Push/pull
operation.

[def [package grammar::me::cpu::core]]

Core functionality for state manipulation and stepping used in the
bytecode based implementation of ME virtual machines.
