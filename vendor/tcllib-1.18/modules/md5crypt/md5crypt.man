[description]
[para]

This package provides an implementation of the MD5-crypt password
encryption algorithm as pioneered by FreeBSD and currently in use as a
replacement for the unix crypt(3) function in many modern
systems. An implementation of the closely related Apache MD5-crypt is
also available.

The output of these commands are compatible with the BSD and OpenSSL
implementation of md5crypt and the Apache 2 htpasswd program.

[section {COMMANDS}]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd "::md5crypt::md5crypt"] \
        [arg "password"] \
        [arg "salt"]]

Generate a BSD compatible md5-encoded password hash from the plaintext
password and a random salt (see SALT).

[call [cmd "::md5crypt::aprcrypt"] \
        [arg "password"] \
        [arg "salt"]]

Generate an Apache compatible md5-encoded password hash from the plaintext
password and a random salt (see SALT).

[call [cmd "::md5crypt::salt"] [opt [arg "length"]]]

Generate a random salt string suitable for use with the [cmd md5crypt] and
[cmd aprcrypt] commands.

[list_end]

[section {SALT}]

The salt passed to either of the encryption schemes implemented here
is checked to see if it begins with the encryption scheme magic string
(either "$1$" for MD5-crypt or "$apr1$" for Apache crypt). If so, this
is removed. The remaining characters up to the next $ and up to a
maximum of 8 characters are then used as the salt. The salt text
should probably be restricted the set of ASCII alphanumeric characters
plus "./" (dot and forward-slash) - this is to preserve maximum
compatability with the unix password file format.
[para]
If a password is being generated rather than checked from a password
file then the [cmd salt] command may be used to generate a random salt.
