[description]
[para]

This package provides a single command for use within [package snit]
type definition (i.e. actually a [cmd snit::macro]) for the convenient
creation of methods which delegate the actual work to a remote
location via a "channel" created by the package [package comm].

[section API]
[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::interp::delegate::method] [opt [option -async]] [arg name] [arg arguments] [arg comm] [arg id]]

This commands creates a method which is named by [arg name]. All
invokations of this method will delegate the actual work to the remote
location identified by the comm channel [arg comm] and the endpoint
[arg id].

[para]

The name of the remote method invoked by the delegator is identical to
the name of the method itself.

[para]

Normally the generated method marshalls the [arg arguments], and
returns the result from the remote method as its own result. If
however the option [option -async] was specified then the generated
method will not wait for a result and return immediately.
