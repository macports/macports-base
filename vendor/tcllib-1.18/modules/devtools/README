Right now this module only contains code to make the handling of sub
processes from within a testsuite easier in general and of minimal
protocol server especially. Things which are not directly within in
the scope of the package "tcltest".

The initial name for the module was 'testsupport'. This was changed to
'devtools' to allow the collection other code here too. Like for
example the generation of TEA 2 compatible configure scripts and
Makefiles.

For now the contents are considered internal to tcllib and are neither
listed in the main makefile, nor do they have a package index file. So
even if the module and its code gets installed it won't be useable
without jumping through some hoops.

The code is used in some of the tcllib testsuites.
Currently: "comm", and "pop3".
