[description]

The [package coroutine] package provides coroutine-aware
implementations of various event- and channel related commands. It can
be in multiple modes:

[list_begin enumerated]

[enum] Call the commands through their ensemble, in code which is
explicitly written for use within coroutines.

[enum] Import the commands into a namespace, either directly, or
through [cmd {namespace path}]. This allows the use from within code
which is not coroutine-aware per se and restricted to specific
namespaces.

[list_end]

A more agressive form of making code coroutine-oblivious than point 2
above is available through the package [package coroutine::auto],
which intercepts the relevant builtin commands and changes their
implementation dependending on the context they are run in, i.e.
inside or outside of a coroutine.

[section API]

All the commands listed below are synchronous with respect to the
coroutine invoking them, i.e. this coroutine blocks until the result
is available. The overall eventloop is not blocked however.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd {coroutine::util after}] [arg delay]]

This command delays the coroutine invoking it by [arg delay]
milliseconds.

[call [cmd {coroutine::util await}] [arg varname]...]

This command is an extension form of the [cmd {coroutine::util vwait}]
command (see below) which waits on a write to one of many named
namespace variables.

[call [cmd {coroutine::util create}] [arg arg]...]

This command creates a new coroutine with an automatically assigned
name and causes it to run the code specified by the arguments.

[call [cmd {coroutine::util exit}] [opt [arg status]]]

This command exits the current coroutine, causing it to return
[arg status]. If no status was specified the default [arg 0] is
returned.

[call [cmd {coroutine::util gets}] [arg chan] [opt [arg varname]]]

This command reads a line from the channel [arg chan] and returns it
either as its result, or, if a [arg varname] was specified, writes it
to the named variable and returns the number of characters read.

[call [cmd {coroutine::util global}] [arg varname]...]

This command imports the named global variables of the coroutine into
the current scope. From the technical point of view these variables
reside in level [const #1] of the Tcl stack. I.e. these are not the
regular global variable in to the global namespace, and each coroutine
can have their own set, independent of all others.

[call [cmd {coroutine::util read}] [option -nonewline] [arg chan] [opt [arg n]]]

This command reads [arg n] characters from the channel [arg chan] and
returns them as its result. If [arg n] is not specified the command
will read the channel until EOF is reached.

[call [cmd {coroutine::util update}] [opt [const idletasks]]]

This command causes the coroutine invoking it to run pending events or
idle handlers before proceeding.

[call [cmd {coroutine::util vwait}] [arg varname]]

This command causes the coroutine calling it to wait for a write to
the named namespace variable [arg varname].
