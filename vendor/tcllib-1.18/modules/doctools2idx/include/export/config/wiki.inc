[section {Wiki markup}]

The basic syntax of the wiki markup generated by this plugin are
described at [uri http://wiki.tcl.tk/14].

[para]

The plugin goes beyond the classic markup to generate proper headers
and either a table or indented list of the keywords and their
references.


[section Configuration]

The wiki export plugin recognizes the following configuration
variables and changes its behaviour as they specify.

[list_begin arguments]

[arg_def dictionary map]

This standard configuration variable contains a dictionary mapping
from the symbolic files names in manpage references to the actual
filenames and/or urls to be used in the output.

[para]

Url references and symbolic file names without a mapping are used
unchanged.

[arg_def enum style]

This variable recognizes two values as legal, [const list] (default),
and [const table].

Depending on the value the plugin generates either a list- or
table-based wiki page for the index.

[list_end]

[emph Note] that this plugin ignores the standard configuration
variables [var user], [var file] and [var format], and their values.
