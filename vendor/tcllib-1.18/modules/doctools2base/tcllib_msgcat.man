[description]

The package [package doctools::msgcat] is a support module handling
the selection of message catalogs for the various document processing
packages in the doctools system version 2. As such it is an internal
package a regular user (developer) should not be in direct contact
with.

If you are such please go the documentation of either

[list_begin enumerated]
[enum] [package doctools::doc],
[enum] [package doctools::toc], or
[enum] [package doctools::idx]
[list_end]

[para]

Within the system architecture this package resides under the various
parser packages, and is shared by them. Underneath it, but not
explicit dependencies, are the packages providing the message catalogs
for the various languages.

[section API]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::doctools::msgcat::init] [arg prefix]]

The command locates and loads the message catalogs for all the
languages returned by [cmd msgcat::mcpreferences], provided that they
could be found. It returns an integer number describing how many
packages were found and loaded.

[para]

The names of the packages the command will look for have the form
"doctools::msgcat::[arg prefix]::[var langcode]", with [arg prefix]
the argument to the command, and the [var langcode] supplied by the
result of [cmd msgcat::mcpreferences].
