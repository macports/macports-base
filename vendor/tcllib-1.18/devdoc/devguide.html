The CVS repository for Tcllib contains two main branches, the HEAD for
development, and RELEASES as the staging area for official
releases. At RELEASES the minor branches containing the various
official releases are anchored at.
</p></td></tr></table>

<p>All the branches are of interest to the developers for
      Tcllib. Ongoing development happens in HEAD, which can be
      unstable or may not work at all. Whenever a developer considers
      a piece of code, or module, he is responsible for as
      sufficiently stable she has to perform an internal release which
      merges this part from HEAD into RELEASES. Tools to help with
      this will be provided.
</p>

<p>The branches for the official releases of tcllib are of interest to
      a developer because it is expected that fixes for important bugs
      not only go into the HEAD branch but also into the release
      branches for the release they were found in and all releases
      following that one. This is to allow the release manager to
      create patch releases of existing releases distributing important
      bugfixes as well.
</p>

<p>Version numbers for modules are handled as described below. This
      way of handling them was chosen so that the modules in the
      development branch always uses version numbers different from
      the version numbers in the official releases made so far.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever an internal release of a module FOO is done, the
	developer performing this internal release has to increment
	the version number of the module <b>after</b> the release was
	executed.
</ul>
