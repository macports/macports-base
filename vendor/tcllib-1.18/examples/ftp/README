Example #1 - Directory Mirror	(mirror.tcl)
-----------------------------

The script mirror.tcl is used to mirror a complete remote directory
structure. It creates an exact copy of this structure on the locale
machine. Three parameters needs to be modified to work properly, 
the hostname of the remote server, the username and the password 
for login. 


Example #2 - Software Update	(newer.tcl)
----------------------------

The script newer.tcl is used to detect whether a new release of
Brent Welch's phantastic tcl-httpd is present at scriptics ftp
server. If ftp::Newer detects a newer file then it causes the
upload process and sends me (as root) an email to inform about. 
The file name for the remote copy of tclhttpd may have changed,
and the script needs a local copy of tclhttpd's source to do
the comparison.

Example #3 - Homepage Update	(hpupdate.tcl)
----------------------------

Quite a few people must have to keep permanent updating their
homepages on a ISP server. hpupdate.tcl is a tk-program for
the interactive comparsion of the homepage directory on the local
computer with the same directories on the remote homepage server. 

It is based on File Transfer Protocol. This process can be automated
easily by hpupdate. It makes it quick and easy to keep the track of
new/old or changed files.

Brief overview: 

     - FTP connection to remote server
     - Processing subdirectories 
     - Display of summary used and selected disk space 
     - Automatically all superfluous directories/files of remote
       homepage server will be deleted 
     - Automatically all new/updated files will be uploaded 
     - Tested under Linux, should also run without problems under
       Windows 95/NT and on Macintosh computers 

Example #4 - TkCon command line ftp client
------------------------------------------

Loading the ftp Library Package into Jeffrey Hobbs' TkCon rovides
a simple ftp command line utility with command history. TkCon is a
replacement for the standard console that comes with Tk. It must be
started with the "package" option: 

      tkcon -package ftp

to load ftp automatically. TkCon is available at
