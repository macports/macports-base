[description]
[para]

Please read [term {Name service facility, introduction}] first.

[para]

The application described by this document, [syscmd nnslog], is a
simple command line client for the nano name service facility provided
by the Tcllib packages [package nameserv], and [package nameserv::server].

[para]

It essentially implements "[syscmd nns] search -continuous *", but
uses a different output formatting. Instead of continuously showing
the current contents of the server in the terminal it simply logs all
received add/remove events to [const stdout].

[para]

This name service facility has nothing to do with the Internet's
[term {Domain Name System}], otherwise known as [term DNS]. If the
reader is looking for a package dealing with that please see either of
the packages [package dns] and [package resolv], both found in Tcllib
too.

[subsection {USE CASES}]

[syscmd nnslog] was written with the following main use case in mind.

[para]
[list_begin enumerated]
[enum]
Monitoring the name service for all changes and logging them in a text
terminal.
[list_end]

[para]

[subsection {COMMAND LINE}]

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd nnslog] \
     [opt "[option -host] [arg host]"] \
     [opt "[option -port] [arg port]"]]

The command connects to the specified name service, sets up a search
for all changes and then prints all received events to stdout, with
each events on its own line. The command will not exit until it is
explicitly terminated by the user. It will especially survive the loss
of the connection to the name service and reestablish the search and
log when the connection is restored.

[para]
The options to specify the name service will be explained later, in
section [sectref OPTIONS].

[list_end]

[subsection OPTIONS]

This section describes all the options available to the user of the
application

[list_begin options]
[opt_def -host name|ipaddress]

If this option is not specified it defaults to [const localhost]. It
specifies the name or ip-address of the host the name service to talk
to is running on.

[opt_def -port number]

If this option is not specified it defaults to [const 38573]. It
specifies the TCP port the name service to talk to is listening on for
requests.
