[description]
[para]

Please read [term {Name service facility, introduction}] first.

[para]

The application described by this document, [syscmd nns], is a simple
command line server for the nano name service facility provided by the
Tcllib packages [package nameserv], and [package nameserv::server].

Beyond that the application's sources also serve as an example of how
to use the server package [package nameserv::server].

[para]

This name service facility has nothing to do with the Internet's
[term {Domain Name System}], otherwise known as [term DNS]. If the
reader is looking for a package dealing with that please see either of
the packages [package dns] and [package resolv], both found in Tcllib
too.

[subsection {USE CASES}]

[syscmd nnsd] was written with the following main use case in
mind.

[para]
[list_begin enumerated]
[enum]
Run a nano name service on some host.

[subsection {COMMAND LINE}]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd nnsd] \
	[opt "[option -localonly] [arg flag]"] \
	[opt "[option -port] [arg port]"]]

The command configures a server per the specified options and starts
it. The command will not exit on its own, as it keeps the name service
database wholly in memory. The user has to kill it explicitly, either
by sending a a signal, or through the job-control facilities of the
shell in use.

[para]
The options to configure the name service are explained in section
[sectref OPTIONS].

[list_end]

[subsection OPTIONS]

This section describes all the options available to the user of the
application

[para]
[list_begin options]
[opt_def -localonly bool]

If this option is not specified it defaults to [const true], i.e.
acceptance of only local connections. The server will accept remote
connections, i.e. connections from other hosts, if and only if this
option is configured to [const false].

[opt_def -port number]

If this option is not specified it defaults to [const 38573]. It
specifies the TCP port the server has to listen on for requests.
