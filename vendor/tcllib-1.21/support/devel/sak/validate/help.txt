    sak validate            ?-v? ?-l|--log STEM? ?MODULE ...?
    sak validate manpages   ?-v? ?-l|--log STEM? ?MODULE ...?
    sak validate versions   ?-v? ?-l|--log STEM? ?MODULE ...?
    sak validate testsuites ?-v? ?-l|--log STEM? ?MODULE ...?
    sak validate syntax     ?-v? ?-l|--log STEM? ?MODULE ...?

    	Validate one or more aspects of the specified modules and the
    	packages they contain. If no module is specified all modules
    	are validated. If no aspect was specified all possible aspects
    	are validated.

        By default the output from a validation run is animated
        feedback of the progress made, plus summarized color-coded
        results. If -v is specified the actual log is returned
        instead.

        If a log STEM is specified the extended log normally activated
        via -v is written to STEM.log while the user is provided with
        the regular feedback during execution. Usage of the -l switch
        overides -v.

	The system is currently able to validate the following aspects
	of the module and package sources:

	manpages
		Reports modules/packages without documentation, and
		modules/packages which have syntactically flawed
		documentation. The second part is identical to

			sak doc validate
			
	versions
		Reports modules and packages with mismatches between
		'package ifneeded' and 'package provided' commands.

	testsuites
		Report modules and packages without testsuites.

		Note that this command is _not_ actually executing the
		testsuites. That is done via

			sak test run ...

		See its documentation (sak help test) for more
		information.

	syntax
		Scan modules and packages using various tools
		statically checking Tcl syntax, and report their
		outputs.
