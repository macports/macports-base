    test -- Execute testsuites

    sak test run ?-s|--shell PATH? ?-l|--log STEM? ?-g|--valgrind? ?-v? ?MODULE ...?

        Run the testsuites of the specified modules, using the shell
        running SAK for the testsuites as well. If no modules are
        specified the testsuites of all modules are run.

        If --valgrind is specified the testsuites are run under the
        valgrind memory checker. NOTE. This feature is not available
        on the windows platform. Requests for it will be ignored.

        If one or more --shell's are specified the testsuites are run
        against them. If none are specified the shells registered with
        'shell add' (see below) are used instead. If none are
        specified the shell executing the sak is used instead.

        By default the output from a run is animated feedback of the
        progress made. If -v is specified the actual log is returned
        instead.

        If a log STEM is specified the extended log normally activated
        via -v is written to STEM.log while the user is provided with
        the regular feedback during execution. In addition the
        summaries from the feedback are written to STEM.summary as
        well, and also sorted into STEM.failures, STEM.skipped, and
        STEM.none. The -l switch overides -v.

    sak test shells

        Returns a list of the registered shells, one per line, used to
        execute the testsuites.

    sak test shell add PATH...

        Adds the specified paths to the list of shells to use when
        executing testsuites.

    sak test shell delete PATH...

        Removes the specified paths from the list of shells to use
        when executing testsuites.

    NOTE: The list of registered shells is a per-user configuration
          setting and is saved in the file "$HOME/.Tcllib/Registry".
