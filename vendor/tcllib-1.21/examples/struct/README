This directory contains some examples regarding the usage of struct
funtionality. For example a small diff tool based on

	struct::list longestCommonSubsequence.

=======================================================================

Example operations:

	tclsh ./diff2.tcl diff.tcl diff2.tcl

		Differences between the diff-tools in pseudo-'patch' form.

	tclsh ./diff.tcl diff.tcl diff2.tcl

		Differences between the diff-tools side by side.
