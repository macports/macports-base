The complete set of procedures is described below.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::textutil::string::chop] [arg string]]

A convenience command. Removes the last character of [arg string] and
returns the shortened string.

[call [cmd ::textutil::string::tail] [arg string]]

A convenience command. Removes the first character of [arg string] and
returns the shortened string.

[call [cmd ::textutil::string::cap] [arg string]]

Capitalizes the first character of [arg string] and returns the
modified string.

[call [cmd ::textutil::string::capEachWord] [arg string]]

Capitalizes the first character of word of the [arg string] and
returns the modified string. Words quoted with either backslash or
dollar-sign are left untouched.

[call [cmd ::textutil::string::uncap] [arg string]]

The complementary operation to [cmd ::textutil::string::cap]. Forces
the first character of [arg string] to lower case and returns the
modified string.

[call [cmd ::textutil::string::longestCommonPrefixList] [arg list]]
[call [cmd ::textutil::string::longestCommonPrefix] [opt [arg string]...]]

Computes the longest common prefix for either the [arg string]s given
to the command, or the strings specified in the single [arg list], and
returns it as the result of the command.

[para]

If no strings were specified the result is the empty string.  If only
one string was specified, the string itself is returned, as it is its
own longest common prefix.
