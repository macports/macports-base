[description]
[para]

The [package tcl::chan::variable] package provides a command creating
channels which live purely in memory. They provide random-access,
i.e. are seekable.

In contrast to the channels created by [package tcl::chan::memchan]
the data is not hidden in the channel however, but stored in an
associated variable, specified at the time of construction.

[para] Packages related to this are [package tcl::chan::memchan] and
[package tcl::chan::string].

[para] The internal [package TclOO] class implementing the channel
handler is a sub-class of the [package tcl::chan::events] framework.
