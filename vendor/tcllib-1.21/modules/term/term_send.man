[description]

This package provides the most primitive commands for sending characters
to a terminal. They are in essence convenient wrappers around the
builtin command [cmd puts].

[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::term::send::wrch] [arg chan] [arg str]]

Send the text [arg str] to the channel specified by the handle [arg chan].
In contrast to the builtin command [cmd puts] this command does not
terminate the string with a line terminator. It also forces an  flush of
Tcl internal and OS buffers to ensure that the characters are processed
immediately.

[call [cmd ::term::send::wr] [arg str]]

This convenience command is like [cmd ::term::send::wrch], except that the
destination channel is fixed to [emph stdout].

[list_end]

[vset CATEGORY term]
[include ../common-text/feedback.inc]
[manpage_end]
