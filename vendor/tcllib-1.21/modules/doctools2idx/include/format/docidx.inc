[section {[docidx] notation of keyword indices}]

The docidx format for keyword indices, also called the
[term {docidx markup language}], is too large to be covered in single
section.

The interested reader should start with the document

[list_begin enum]
[enum]	[manpage {docidx language introduction}]
[list_end]

and then proceed from there to the formal specifications, i.e. the
documents

[list_begin enum]
[enum]	[manpage {docidx language syntax}] and
[enum]	[manpage {docidx language command reference}].
[list_end]

to get a thorough understanding of the language.
