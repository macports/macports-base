2013-07-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man: Ticket [8b317b4a63]: Added code to the 8.4+
	* fileutil.tcl: implementations of GLOBF and GLOBD to guard
	* fileutil.test: ourselves against VFS packages mishandling the
	* pkgIndex.tcl: -types option of [glob]. vfs::zip is an example.
	  This mishandling causes glob to return the same data for the two
	  calls with "-types x" and "-types {hidden x}", generating lists
	  with duplicate entries. We now generally de-duplicate the result
	  ourselves. Bumped the package version to 1.14.6. Thanks to
	  <eugene.mindrov@gmail.com> for the investigation identifying
	  this problem.

2013-02-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* decode.tcl: Bumped fileutil::decode to 0.2 to distinguish
	* pkgIndex.tcl: properly from the 0.1.xxx version which existed in
	  AS/perforce before it moved to tcllib/fossil. That should have
	  been done as part of the move, and was forgotten.

2013-02-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.15 ========================
	*

2013-01-28  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* decode.tcl: New. Simple package to support writing decoders
	* pkgIndex.tcl: for binary files.

2013-01-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: [Bug 3147481], [Bug 3141568]. Fixed issues with
	* fileutil.tcl: changes to [glob]'s behaviour in 8.5+, reported
	* find.setup: by guardus@users.sourceforge.net. Plus [Bug 3599839]
	* find.test: reminding us of these, and Win 7. Bumped version to
	* pkgIndex.tcl: 1.14.5. Extended testsuite, can be repro'd under
	  Unix also.

2012-08-29  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* traverse.tcl (Init): Fixed a bug where a symlink to the
	* traverse.man: base directory was not handled correctly.
	* traverse.test: It got expanded and should not have been.
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Cause was missing initialization of the _known set
	* find.setup: with the normalized base path. Added test for this.
	  Bumped version to 0.4.3.

2011-12-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.14 ========================
	*

2011-12-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* traverse.tcl: Mark directories as 'known' only if we decided
	* traverse.man: to recurse into them. Otherwise a link to a
	* pkgIndex.tcl: directory we choose to not follow may non-
	  deterministically prevent us from recursing into the original
	  directory, depending on the order we encounter them in. Bumped
	  package version to 0.4.2.

2011-01-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.13 ========================
	*

2010-06-16  Andreas Kupries  <akupries@shaw.ca>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::fileType): Fumbled the extension of
	* fileutil.man: the doctools/toc/idx detector in the last change.
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Fixed the bogosity, merging the separate checks.
	  Bumped to version 1.14.4.

2010-06-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::fileType): Extended to recognize tklib
	* fileutil.man: diagram files, and extended the doctools/toc/idx
	* pkgIndex.tcl: detector to accept markers in the same style as
	  for tklib diagrams. Bumped to version 1.14.3.

2009-12-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.12 ========================
	*

2009-11-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl: Extended the doctools/toc/idx detector with
	* fileutil.man: checks for inclusion and exclusion markers
	* pkgIndex.tcl: allowing the user to force acceptance or rejection
	of files for complex situations (like an include file looking like
	a doctools main file but not bein so, and the converse, a main
	file lacking the regular marker, which is hidden in an included
	file). Bumped to version 1.14.2.

2009-10-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::stripPath): [Bug 2872536]. Fixed both
	* fileutil.man: issues. Compare the canonical list representations
	* pkgIndex.tcl: for the \\bar problem, and separate $prefix from
	* strip.test: '*' by a space to prevent matching on a partial path
	  segment. Thanks to Ashok P. Nadkarni
	  <apnadkarni@users.sourceforge.net> for the report. Bumped the
	  version to 1.14.1. Extended the testsuite.

	* pathops.test: Cleaned up some win vs unix issues in the tests.

2009-10-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.test: Added fixes to test cleanups, to prevents errors
	* inplace.test: when the testsuite is only run partially.
	* test.test:

2009-09-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl: Renamed the internal command 'LexNormalize' to
	* fileutil.man: 'lexnormalize' and documented it, making it
	* pkgIndex.tcl: public. Bumped version to 1.14. This closes and
	  accepts the feature request [SF Tcllib Bug 2855302]. Tests are
	  currently only indirect, through testing of commands 'jail' and
	  'relativeUrl'.

2009-04-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* multiop.tcl (Copy): Fix special case with copying directories
	* multiop.man: where the source is one level to deep, or copy fails.
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Bumped version to 0.5.3.

2009-02-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* traverse.man: Fixed bug in the requirements, this package
	* traverse.tcl: needs fileutil (-> fullnormalize). Bumped
	* pkgIndex.tcl: version to 0.4.1.

2009-02-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::stripPath): Fixed handling
	* fileutil.man: of letter-case on windows, comparisons
	* strip.test: have to be case-insensitive. Bumped version
	* pkgIndex.tcl: to 1.13.6. See [SF Tcllib Bug 2499641].

2008-12-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pkgIndex.tcl: internal command recently removed from the
	  struct::stack package. Bumped version to 0.5.1.

2008-05-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

2007-08-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* multiop.tcl (ChDir, ChUp): Fixed the method calls in change dir
	* multiop.man: operations, forget the $self. Version bumped to 0.4.
	* pkgIndex.tcl:

2007-08-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* multiop.tcl (Expand): Fixed bug in recursive expansion, pattern
	  applies to the last segment of the path.

	* multiop.tcl: New features coming out of dog-fooding: Removed
	* multiop.man: hardwired fixation on files, accept all paths by
	* multiop.test: default, and added commands to allow the user to
	* multi.test: limit the expansion to files, firectories, or links.
	* pkgIndex.tcl: New command to allow the user to specify how
	  strict checking of the 'in(to)' argument is, and if empty
	  expansions are acceptable. Documentation updated. Testsuite
	  updated and extended. Version bumped to 0.3

2007-08-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* multiop.tcl: New features - Recursive processing.
	* multiop.test: Expand only mode. Save/restore set of files
	* pkgIndex.tcl: to/from a variable. Platform checking
	* multi.test: semi-conditional commands. Invoke a user command for
	* multiop.man: the file set. Test suite extended, documentation
	  updated. Version bumped to 0.2

	* fileutil.tcl: The rewrite of find changed how it invoked the
	* fileutil.man: filter command. As that however is documented this
	* pkgIndex.tcl: change is a bug. Restored the old way of invoking
	* find.test: the filter command. Version bumped to 1.13.3.
	  Extended the testsuite to verify the API.

2007-08-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* inplace.test: Fixed failures of some tests on Windows.

	* fileutil.tcl: Working around a possible bug in the handling of
	  path intreps by the core, on Windows. See commentary in
	  'fullnormalize', and 'find.setup' (f_setupcircle).

	* find.test: Moved the support code into a separate file, the new
	* find.setup: 'find.setup'. Added a testsuite for the package
	* traverse.test: 'fileutil::traverse', using the same support
	* traverse.tcl: code. Rewrote the internals of traverse.tcl based
	* traverse.man: on the experience gained by the rewrite of 'find',
	* pkgIndex.tcl: using similar re-focatorization of the platform
	  and core dependencies, and made the traversal state variables
	  easier to understand (separated the processing and result
	  stack). Bumped version of traverse to 0.3.

2007-08-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* find.test: Reworked the setup/cleanup code, made the tests more
	  independent from each other.

	* traverse.man: New file, first documentation for
	  fileutil::traverse.

2007-08-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::find): Command rewritten to use a
	* pkgIndex.tcl: portable iterative traversal core. Platform and
	* fileutil.man: Tcl version dependencies have been re-factored
	  into separate small commands. Should be more readable and
	  maintainable. Handling of circular symbolic links is now
	  portable (via a portable 'file normalize'). Order of paths in
	  the output changed, this however was never documented. Version
	  bumped to 1.13.2.

2007-08-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.test: Cleaned the setup/cleanup code up a bit.

	* filetype.test: Split the overly large file fileutil.test
	* fileutil.test: into a series of smaller test files for
	* find.test: specific commands.
	* inplace.test:
	* pathops.test:
	* strip.test:
	* test.test:

2007-08-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.test: Fixed problems with the tests for
	  fileutil::writeFile and companions. The regsub did not like
	  paths containing special characters like '+'. Replaced with a
	  'string map' construction.

	* multiop.tcl: Language tweak. Allow 'from', and 'into' (and aliases)
	* multiop.man: as qualifiers to 'the', i.e. allow specification after
	* multiop.test: 'the'. Updates documentation and examples too.

	* multi.tcl: Added documentation and testsuite for the multiop
	* multi.man: package built on top of the multiop objects. Bug
	* multi.test: fixes.
	* multiop.tcl:
	* multiop.man:
	* multiop.test:

2007-07-31  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* multiop.man: Wrote the actual documentation for the core
	* multiop.tcl: multi-file objects. Tweaked the syntax a bit.

2007-07-31  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* multiop.tcl: New packages in module. Scatter/gather
	* multiop.test: operations, multi-file operations.
	* multiop.man: First user of 'wip' code.
	* multi.tcl:
	* pkgIndex.tcl:

2007-07-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl: Fixed problems of 'relative' and 'relativeUrl'
	* fileutil.man: with paths containing . and .., i.e. like
	* fileutil.test: '/foo/bar/../common'. Done by making the paths
	* pkgIndex.man: absolute and then using LexNormalize to remove
	  them. Added a fast path to LexNormalize to quickly return for
	  paths not containing . nor .. Also fixed bug in handling .. with
	  short relative paths. Extended the testsuite. Package bumped to
	  version 1.13.1 (patchlevel, bugfixes only).

2007-06-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::fullnormalize): Simplified the
	  implementation by recognizing that the complex
	  file split/lrange/eval/join combo is just 'file dirname'.

2007-06-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* traverse.tcl: Fixed invokation of -filter callback when used for
	* pkgIndex.tcl:	directories. Wrongly used only the short path. Now
	  correctly uses the full name. Bumped package version to 0.2.

2007-05-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Added command 'tempdirReset' to allow users to
	* fileutil.man: clear the information set via 'tempdir path'.
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Bumped package to version 1.13. Additionally
	  extended relative-url computation to make the result of an
	  edge-case nicer looking (result was ok, but not
	  optimal). Extended testsuite for this. Extended error output
	  when computation of relative path fails.

2007-03-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::fileType): Added definitions to
	* pkgIndex.tcl: recognize Apple .icns files.

	  commands. Added a section about how to give feedback.

2007-03-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::TempDir): Added code to collect all
	* pkgIndex.tcl: problems encountered, to be reported if no temp
	* fileutil.man: directory could be found, to aid in the
	  debugging of the situation. Bumped version up to 1.11.

2007-02-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Added a command [fileutil::fullnormalize].
	* fileutil.man: Documented it, extended the testsuite. Bumped
	* filetuil.test: version up to 1.10. Removed nonsensical
	* pkgIndex.tcl: [file join one_element] calls from the testsuite.

2006-10-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Marked all 20 permission dependent tests as
	  'notRoot' as they cannot fail when the superuser executes the
	  testsuite.

2006-10-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Rewritten to use new features for handling the
	  environment.

2006-09-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Fixed 8.3isms in the testsuite. Symbolic
	  permissions for 'file attributes' are not available in 8.2 yet
	  :(. Also fixed the tests using hardcoded wrong#args messages to
	  use the compatibility commands instead.

2006-09-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Fixed 8.4ism in the testsuite of a 8.2+ package.

	  dev/inode cache, and moved the restoration of the old working
	  directory in the 8.3 glob -directory emulation to their proper
	  place.

	* traverse.tcl: New file. Object based directory traversal,
	* pkgIndex.tcl: incremental at the core, i.e. can be event-
	  driven. Iterative algorithm, no trouble with deep directory
	  structures anymore. Not documented yet, no testsuite yet.

2006-03-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Removed some hardcoded paths into my
	  system. Thanks to Michael Schlenker for catching this.

2006-03-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: both documentation and testsuite.

	* fileutil.tcl:  Added a 'test' command for the quick testing of
	* fileutil.man:  several properties of a given path. Extended
	* fileutil.test: both documentation and testsuite.

	* fileutil.man: Updated the documentation to cover all the new
	  commands.

	* fileutil.test: Extended testsuite to cover the command

	  wrote the unchanged input back instead of the transformation
	  result.

2006-02-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Extended the testsuite to cover the commands
	  'appendToFile', 'insertIntoFile', 'removeFromFile', and
	  'replaceInFile'.

	* fileutil.tcl: Added argument validation to the commands
	  'appendToFile', 'insertIntoFile', 'removeFromFile', and
	  'replaceInFile'. Modified their implementation to use shorter
	  implementations for the degenerate cases.

2006-02-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Extended testsuite to cover the command
	  'writeFile'.

	* fileutil.test: Fixed use and cleanup of temp.files.

2006-01-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: More boilerplate simplified via use of test support.

2006-01-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Hooked into the new common test support code.

2006-01-18  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man: Fixed a typo, clarified usage of the filtercmd for
	  find (Boolean result), added an example for that as well. This
	  fixes the [SF Tcllib Bug 1409083] submitted by Glenn Jackman
	  <glennjnn@users.sourceforge.net>.

2005-10-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.8 ========================
	*

2005-09-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test (tempdir-1.2): Added code to remove the env
	  variable TEMP as well. It is set on my host and can thus
	  interfere with the test.

2005-06-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Fixed a bug in find, where it excluded symbolic
	* fileutil.tcl:  links if the destination was circular. This is
	  wrong. The link itself can be listed in the result, it just must
	  not be followed. Otherwise even non-circular links are not listed.

2005-02-14  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man (find): Documented the implicit arguments to the
	  filter command (current working directory). This fixes [SF
	  Tcllib Bug 1048995].

2005-02-10  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileutil::jail): Fixed a problem reported by Pat
	  Thoyts. Test jail-2.1 failed on windows. The reason was improper
	  handling of volume-relative paths. They have to be handled like
	  absolute paths, but were not. Changed the initial if condition a
	  bit to fix this.

2005-02-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Made glob patterns platform-dependent. This fixes
	  [SF Tcllib Bug 1098039].

2005-02-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Added test case for the handling of dot-files by
	  [find]. This is for [SF Tcllib Bug 1098039].

2005-02-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Completed implementation and testing of the 'jail'
	  command which ensures that a path is inside a specific
	  directory. Implemented a 'LexNormalize' helper
	  command.

	* fileutil.test: Added additional test for 'jail' beyond our
	  current suite.

2005-02-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Implemented command 'stripPath'. Like 'stripPwd'
	  for a general prefix path [SF Tcllib RFE 1040372].

	* fileutil.test: Added tests for 'stripPath.
	* fileutil.man: Documented 'stripPath'.

2005-02-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Added tests for the 'Normalize' forward
	  compatibility wrapper. Got them from the Tcl testsuite for 'file
	  normalize'. Added tests for the new 'jail' command.

	* fileutil.tcl: Wrote a forward compatibility implementation of
	  'file normalize', for use with a Tcl core < 8.4. Updated the
	  (non)use of 'file normalize' by 'tempdir' and 'tempfile'.
	  Updated the namespace export clause. Implemented the 'jail'
	  command [SF Tcllib RFE 111076].

2005-02-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Extended tests for the case of inacessible
	  directories.

	* fileutil.tcl (find): Fixed SF [Tcllib Bug 1111153]. This is the
	  same as [Tcllib SF Bug 862491]. Catching problems now when
	  cd'ing into the chosen base directory, and ignoring all
	  directories for which the [cd] fails (permissions).

2005-01-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: Fixed the doctools syntax error in the new text
	  from the last entry.

2005-01-26  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.man: Added a small note on the measure used to count
	  elements in fileutil::stripN.

2004-10-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.7 ========================
	*

2004-09-29  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Introduced a "makeBinaryFile" command to ensure
	  the correct generation of the example files which contain
	  binary. Thanks to Greg Baker <gregb@ifost.org.au> for noticing
	  the problem on his Mac OS X box and helping in debugging it.

2004-09-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Fixed platform problems in testsuite, bad
	  characters in filenames for Windows.

2004-06-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileType): Added code to recognize files written
	  in the doctools, doctoc, and docidx documentation formats.

2004-05-30  Aaron Faupell <afaupell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: added tests for dos executables, tar, zip, bmp, wav, and mp3 to fileType
	* fileutil.man: updated to reflect new types for fileType

2004-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Updated version number to sync with 1.6.1
	* fileutil.man: release.
	* pkgIndex.tcl:

2004-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6.1 ========================
	*

2004-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Rel. engineering. Updated version number
	* fileutil.man: of fileutil to reflect its changes, to 1.6.1.
	* pkgIndex.tcl:

2004-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Cleaning up after Aaron. Updated the test
	  filetype-1.12 to look for the extended return value of fileType
	  when applied to jpeg images. The last checkin changed this, but
	  the test was not updated as well, most likely not even
	  run. Found and corrected during release preparation and testing.

2004-05-11  Aaron Faupell <afaupell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: updated the jpeg test to recognize exif format

2004-02-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6 ========================
	*

2004-02-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: The tempdir tests used advanced test syntax not
	  available before 8.4 (IIRC). Not useable for 8.2. Ditto the lot of
	  the install tests also used 8.3 and 8.4 features. Straightened
	  the bad syntax out (killed the tests), and added proper
	  constraints to the tests.

	* fileutil.tcl: Ooops. fileutil is certified for usage with Tcl
	  8.2, there is no [file normalize] before 8.4. Made the usage
	  (See 2004-02-03) conditional.

2004-02-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Modified the tests a bit to use glob characters
	  in file names to check that the code is robust against that too.

	  See http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi?id=29491

2004-02-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (tempdir, tempfile): Now [file normalize]'ing the
	  results of these two commands. More windows friendly.

2004-01-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileutil::find): Fixed bug in handling a single
	  file as base directory: The initial list was not set up as a
	  list, and the test results (see below) were not listified either
	  for these cases. That broke down for paths containing
	  spaces. Also fixed: Neither the windows nor the pre-8.4 version
	  of the command had been modified to deal with a single file.
	  Oversight from the change @ 2003-10-22 by David N. Welton
	  <davidw@dedasys.com>.

	  Regularized a number of error returns.

	* fileutil.test: Changed testsuite to use files and directories
	  containing spaces in their names. A number of tests
	  failed. Modified the tempdir tests to better exclude and
	  manipulate the environment to enforce the wanted result.

2004-01-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileType): The check for an attached metakit
	  database left a channel on the tested file open. This causes the
	  application to leak channels, and on windows the file is also
	  locked against deletion. Fixed.

2003-11-15  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.man: Added new test and docs for change below.

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::cat): Make cat accept multiple files
	(bug [830075]).

2003-10-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man: Better formatting of the new docs.

2003-10-25  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.man: Documented 'fileutil::tempdir' algorithm.

2003-10-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man: Updated documentation, added description of
	  'fileutil::tempdir'.

2003-10-23  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.test (tempdir): Added a few very simple tests for
	  tempdir under Unix.

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::tempdir): Added tempdir
	  implementation.
	  (::fileutil::tempfile): Use new tempdir command.

2003-10-22  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::find): Change Unix version of find
	  command to accept a file (as opposed to a directory) as an
	  argument.  This reflects the behavior of the Unix find
	  command. This change also needs to be added to the windows
	  version, but should probably be done by someone who can test it
	  on that platform.
	  (::fileutil::install): -m option only works on Unix, as far as I
	  know.
	  (::fileutil::install): Make sure correct thing is chmod'ed.

	* fileutil.test: Added tests for find to check that it works ok
	  with a single file as an argument.  Also, error out if initial
	  file does not correspond to 'isfile' or 'isdirectory'.

2003-09-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileutil::fileType): Fixed the SourceForge Tcllib
	  bug [795585]. We are now allowing whitespace between the #! and
	  path of the script interpreter. Extended to identify metakit
	  databases, also when attached to another file.

	  (tempfile): Added 'global env', access to 'env' was bad, causing
	  malfunction on windows.

2003-08-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man: Fixed a bad call of [cmd] in the documentation of
	  the new install command. Always use 'sak validate moldule' to
	  validate the whole module, or 'sak text module' when wishing to
	  validate only the documentation.

2003-08-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (find): The fix for SF tcllib bug [647974]
	  introduced a tcl command new to tcl 8.4. This command is
	  [file system]. Changing the code to exclude dev/inode checking
	  only for 8.4 and above. For versions of Tcl below 8.4. the fix
	  is not required as they do not have virtual filesystem
	  support. This fixes SF tcllib bug [784157].

2003-08-06  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.man: Added documentation for the new 'install' command.

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::install): Added 'install' command,
	which is similar in functionality to the Unix install command - it
	is basically file copy with some additional features.

	* fileutil.test: Added tests for 'install' fileutil command.

2003-07-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Bumped version to 1.5.1 as this is a bug fix. Any bug fixes and
	  more minor changes coming in the future do not have to bump the
	  version number anymore until the next release. Only a major
	  change warrants another bump before the release.

	* fileutil.tcl: Fixed SF tcllib bug [647974]. We now ignore
	  device/inode information if the current path is in a virtual
	  filesystem. We also assume now that VFS's do not support links,
	  thus also obviating the need for the data, circles cannot occur.

2003-05-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::tempfile): Braced [expr].

2003-05-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.4 ========================
	*

2003-05-01  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl:   The touch command cannot be implemented in Tcl
	* fileutil.test:  versions < 8.3 so do not define the command.
	* fileutil.man:   Noted in documentation and skipped tests.

2003-04-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.tcl: Added command [tempfile]. Was part of tcllib patch
	  611595, but has a better place here.

2003-04-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.tcl:
	* pkgIndex.tcl:  Set version of the package to to 1.5.

2003-04-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.test (fileutil): Fixed tcllib SF bug #714214 reported
	  by Pat Thoyts, by working around the 'makeFile' command provided
	  with tcltest. It seems to have issues when doing binary data.

2003-03-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl (fileutil::touch): Applied patch #688965 provided
	  by Glenn Jackman <glennjnn@users.sourceforge.net>. This patch
	  provides a better message when asking the [fileutil::touch]
	  command for help.

2003-03-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.tcl: Fixed bug #707009, reported by Helmut Giese
	  <hgiese@users.sourceforge.net>, also updated the documentation
	  and the testsuite.

2003-01-28  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* fileutil.tcl (::fileutil::fileType): Use 'string match' instead
	  of regexp.  Require Tcl 8.2.

2003-01-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: More semantic markup, less visual one.

2002-10-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl:
	* fileutil.man:
	* fileutil.test: Accepted enhanced format detection by Philip
	  Ehrens <pehrens@ligo.caltech.edu>.

2002-05-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl (cat): Fixed bug #556504, reported by Michael
	  A. Cleverly <cleverly@users.sourceforge.net>. The fix was
	  provided by Michael too. The problem was reading files which are
	  reported as size 0, but actually have content, just dynamically
	  generated (Linux /proc is an example of an fs containing such
	  files).

2002-05-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: Documented the two new commands (stripN,
	  stripPwd).

	* fileutil.tcl: Made up my mind about SF Bug #462015. The proposed
	  interface change to [find] is rejected to keep the interface of
	  the library procedure simple and without hidden surprises =
	  KISS. Added a command [stripPwd] instead which can be used by
	  the caller of [find] to make the returned paths relative to the
	  current working directory. Also added [stripN] to strip a fixed
	  number of elements from the beginning of a path.

2002-04-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.man: Added doctools manpage.
	* fileutils.n: Updated to reflect change of version.

2002-03-20  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Bumped version to 1.4

	* fileutil.n:
	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.tcl: Added fileType command posted to comp.lang.tcl by
	  Phil Ehrens, with some minor modifications.

2002-01-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Bumped version to 1.3

2001-12-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test: Restricted tests 2.2 and 2.3 to the directory
	  structure created for the test and not the whole directory the
	  test is run in. Bugfix for item #486572.

2001-11-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.n:
	* fileutil.tcl: Applied patch #477805 by Glenn Jackman
	  <glennjnn@users.sourceforge.net> implementing the unix 'touch'
	  command. Contains documentation and testsuite for the new
	  command too.

2001-09-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Restricted export list to public API.
	  [456255]. Patch by Hemang Lavana
	  <hemanglavana@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-08-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* All of the changes below are related to tcllib Patch [449531] by
	  Anselm Lingnau <lingnau@users.sourceforge.net>. Instead of
	  taking in the proposed highlevel 'fileinput' I added some of the
	  more low-level commands from Tclx which can be used to
	  create/compose 'fileinput'.

	* pkgIndex.tcl: Moved version of fileutil to 1.2.

	* fileutil.test: Added tests for the new commands. Moved version
	  of fileutil to 1.2.

	* fileutil.n: Added documentation of the new commands. Moved
	  version of fileutil to 1.2.

	* fileutil.tcl (findByPattern, foreachLine): New commands, modeled
	  after TclX's 'recursive_glob' and 'for_file'. Moved version of
	  fileutil to 1.2.

2001-07-31  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.n: Added manpage documenting the commands. tcllib Bug
	  [446584].

2001-06-21  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: Fixed dubious code reported by frink.

2001-03-20  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fileutil.tcl: [Bug #410104, Patch #410106]
	  New implementation of ::fileutil::find for unixoid OSs using
	  stat and device/inode configuration to detect and break circular
	  softlink structures. This implementation also skips un'stat'able
	  files and directories.

	* fileutil.test: Added fileutil-1.4 testing the circle breaker
	  (only under unix).

2000-03-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* fileutil.test:
	* fileutil.tcl: Added cat function, duplicates standard UNIX "cat"
	  utility.

2000-03-09  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* fileutil.test: Collected tests into one file; adapted tests for
	  use in/out of tcllib test framework.
