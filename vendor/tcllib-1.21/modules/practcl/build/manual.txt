[description]
The Practcl module is a tool for integrating large modules for C API
Tcl code that requires custom Tcl types and TclOO objects.
[para]
The concept with Practcl is that is a single file package that can
assist any tcl based project with distribution, compilation, linking,
VFS preparation, executable assembly, and installation. Practcl also
allows one project to invoke the build system from another project,
allowing complex projects such as a statically linked basekit to be
assembled with relative ease.
[para]
Practcl ships as a single file, and aside from a Tcl 8.6 interpreter,
has no external dependencies.
