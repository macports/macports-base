These files are mail sending test scripts written in various scripting
languages. The purpose of these is to check that our SMTPd
inter-operates successfully with everyone else's SMTP client software.

Feel free to add a test script for your favourite other language - or to
improve the usage of any of the current languages.

mail-test.pl  - Perl test script
mail-test.py  - Python test
mail-test.rb  - Ruby test
mail-test.php - PHP test (requires some php.ini configuration)
php.ini       - PHP ini file (default for Windows installations) 
mail-test.tcl - and of course, a Tcl client!
