[description]
[para]

The [package ldap] package provides a Tcl-only client library
for the LDAPv3 protocol as specified in

RFC 4511 ([uri http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt]).

It works by opening the standard (or secure) LDAP socket on the
server, and then providing a Tcl API to access the LDAP protocol
commands.  All server errors are returned as Tcl errors (thrown) which
must be caught with the Tcl [cmd catch] command.

[section {TLS Security Considerations}]

[para] This package uses the [package TLS] package to handle the
security for [const LDAPS] connections.

[para] Policy decisions like the set of protocols to support and what
ciphers to use are not the responsibility of [package TLS], nor of
this package itself however.

Such decisions are the responsibility of whichever application is
using the package, and are likely influenced by the set of servers
the application will talk to as well.

[para] For example, in light of the recent
[uri http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html \
{POODLE attack}] discovered by Google many servers will disable support
for the SSLv3 protocol.

To handle this change the applications using [package TLS] must be
patched, and not this package, nor [package TLS] itself.

Such a patch may be as simple as generally activating [const tls1]
support, as shown in the example below.

[example {
    ldap::tlsoptions -tls1 1 -ssl2 0 -ssl3 0 ;# forcibly activate support for the TLS1 protocol

    ... your own application code ...
}]


[section COMMANDS]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::ldap::connect] [arg host] [opt [arg port]]]

Opens a LDAPv3 connection to the specified [arg host], at the given
[arg port], and returns a token for the connection. This token is the
[arg handle] argument for all other commands. If no [arg port] is
specified it will default to [const 389].

[para]

The command blocks until the connection has been established, or
establishment definitely failed.

[call [cmd ::ldap::tlsoptions] [cmd reset]]

This command resets TLS options to default values. It returns the
set of options.
Using this command is incompatible with the obsolete
form of [cmd ::ldap::secure_connect] and [cmd ::ldap_starttls].

[call [cmd ::ldap::tlsoptions] [opt "[arg opt1] [arg val1]"] [opt "[arg opt2] [arg val2]"] ...]

This commands adds one or more options to some value, and may be used
more than one time in order to add options in several steps.  A complete
description of options may be found in the [package tls] package
documentation. Valid options and values are:

[list_begin options]
[opt_def {-cadir} directory  ]

Provide the directory containing the CA certificates.
No default.

[opt_def {-cafile} file]

Provide the CA file.
No default.

[opt_def {-cipher} string]

Provide the cipher suites to use.
No default.

[opt_def {-dhparams} file]

Provide a Diffie-Hellman parameters file.
No default.

[opt_def {-request} boolean]

Request a certificate from peer during SSL handshake.
Default: true.

[opt_def {-require} boolean]

Require a valid certificate from peer during SSL handshake. If this is
set to true then -request must also be set to true.
Default: false

[opt_def {-servername} host]

Only available if the OpenSSL library the TLS package is linked against
supports the TLS hostname extension for 'Server Name Indication'
(SNI). Use to name the logical host we are talking to and expecting a
certificate for.
No default.

[opt_def {-ssl2} bool]

Enable use of SSL v2.
Default: false

[opt_def {-ssl3} bool]

Enable use of SSL v3.
Default: false

[opt_def {-tls1} bool]

Enable use of TLS v1
Default: true

[opt_def {-tls1.1} bool]

Enable use of TLS v1.1
Default: true

[opt_def {-tls1.2} bool]

Enable use of TLS v1.2
Default: true

[list_end]
[para]

This command returns the current set of TLS options and values.
In particular, one may use this command without any arguments to get
the current set of options.

[para]

Using this command is incompatible with the obsolete
form of [cmd ::ldap::secure_connect] and [cmd ::ldap_starttls]
(see below).

[call [cmd ::ldap::secure_connect] [arg host] [opt [arg port]]]

Like [cmd ::ldap::connect], except that the created connection is
secured by SSL. The port defaults to [const 636].  This command
depends on the availability of the package [package TLS], which is a
SSL binding for Tcl. If [package TLS] is not available, then this
command will fail.

[para]

TLS options are specified with [cmd ::ldap::tlsoptions].

[para]

The command blocks until the connection has been established, or
establishment definitely failed.


[call [cmd ::ldap::secure_connect] [arg host] [opt [arg port]] [opt [arg verify_cert]] [opt [arg sni_servername]]]

Note: this form of the command is deprecated, since TLS options had
to be specified with a combination of parameters to this command
([arg verify_cert] and [arg sni_servername]) and arguments to [cmd ::tls::init]
(from package [package tls]) for example to setup defaults for trusted
certificates. Prefer the above form (without the [arg verify_cert] and
[arg sni_servername] parameters) and set TLS options with
[cmd ::ldap::tlsoptions].

[para]

If [arg verify_cert] is set to 1, the default, this checks the server certificate against
the known hosts. If [arg sni_servername] is set, the given hostname is used as the 
hostname for Server Name Indication in the TLS handshake.

[para]

Use [cmd ::tls::init] to setup defaults for trusted certificates.

[para]

TLS supports different protocol levels. In common use are the versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.
By default all those versions are offered. If you need to modify the acceptable
protocols, you can change the ::ldap::tlsProtocols list (deprecated).

[call [cmd ::ldap::disconnect] [arg handle]]

Closes the ldap connection refered to by the token
[arg handle]. Returns the empty string as its result.

[call [cmd ::ldap::starttls] [arg handle]]

Start TLS negotiation on the connection denoted by [arg handle],
with TLS parameters set with [cmd ::ldap::tlsoptions].

[call [cmd ::ldap::starttls] [arg handle] [opt [arg cafile]] [opt [arg certfile]] [opt [arg keyfile]] [opt [arg verify_cert]] [opt [arg sni_servername]]]

Note: this form of the command is deprecated, since TLS options had
to be specified with a combination of parameters to this command
([arg cafile], [arg certfile], [arg keyfile], [arg verify_cert]
and [arg sni_servername]) and arguments to [cmd ::tls::init]
(from package [package tls]).
Prefer the above form (without specific TLS arguments)
and set TLS options with [cmd ::ldap::tlsoptions].

[para]

Start TLS negotiation on the connection denoted by [arg handle].

You need to set at least the [arg cafile] argument to a file with trusted certificates, if [arg verify_cert] is 1, which is the default.
The [arg sni_servername] can be used to signal a different hostname during the TLS handshake.

The announced protocols are determined in the same way as [cmd ::ldap::secure_connect].

You can specify a TLS client certificate with the [arg certfile] and [arg keyfile] options.

[call [cmd ::ldap::bind] [arg handle] [opt [arg name]] [opt [arg password]]]

This command authenticates the ldap connection refered to by the token
in [arg handle], with a user name and associated password. It blocks
until a response from the ldap server arrives. Its result is the empty
string.

Both [arg name] and [arg passwd] default to the empty string if they
are not specified.

By leaving out [arg name] and [arg passwd] you can make an anonymous bind to
the ldap server.

You can issue [cmd ::ldap::bind] again to bind with different credentials.

[call [cmd ::ldap::bindSASL] [arg handle] [opt [arg name]] [opt [arg password]]]

This command uses SASL authentication mechanisms to do a multistage bind.

Its otherwise identical to the standard [cmd ::ldap::bind].

This feature is currently experimental and subject to change. See the documentation
for the [package SASL] and the [file SASL.txt] in the tcllib CVS repository for
details how to setup and use SASL with openldap.

[call [cmd ::ldap::unbind] [arg handle]]

This command asks the ldap server to release the last bind done for
the connection refered to by the token in [arg handle].

The [arg handle] is invalid after the unbind, as the server closes the connection.
So this is effectivly just a more polite disconnect operation.

[call [cmd ::ldap::search] [arg handle] [arg baseObject] [arg filterString] [arg attributes] [arg options]]

This command performs a LDAP search below the [arg baseObject] tree
using a complex LDAP search expression [arg filterString] and returns
the specified [arg attributes] of all matching objects (DNs). If the
list of [arg attributes] was empty all attributes are returned. The
command blocks until it has received all results.

The valid [arg options] are identical to the options listed for [cmd ::ldap::searchInit].

[para]
An example of a search expression is
[para]
[example {
    set filterString "|(cn=Linus*)(sn=Torvalds*)"
}]
[para]

The return value of the command is a list of nested dictionaries. The
first level keys are object identifiers (DNs), second levels keys are
attribute names. In other words, it is in the form

[para]
[example {
    {dn1 {attr1 {val11 val12 ...} attr2 {val21...} ...}} {dn2 {a1 {v11 ...} ...}} ...
}]
[para]

[call [cmd ::ldap::searchInit] [arg handle] [arg baseObject] [arg filterString] [arg attributes] [arg options]]

This command initiates a LDAP search below the [arg baseObject] tree
using a complex LDAP search expression [arg filterString].
The search gets the specified [arg attributes] of all matching objects (DNs).

The command itself just starts the search, to retrieve the actual results, use
[cmd ::ldap::searchNext].
A search can be terminated at any time by
[cmd ::ldap::searchEnd]. This informs the server that no further results should be sent by sending and ABANDON message
and cleans up the internal state of the search.

Only one [cmd ::ldap::search] can be active at a given time, this
includes the introspection commands [cmd {::ldap::info saslmechanisms}], [cmd {ldap::info control}] and
[cmd {ldap::info extensions}], which invoke a search internally.

Error responses from the server due to wrong arguments or similar things are returned
with the first [cmd ::ldap::searchNext] call and should be checked and dealed with there.

If the list of requested [arg attributes] is empty all attributes will be returned.
The parameter [arg options] specifies the options to be used in the search,
and has the following format:

[para]
[example {
    {-option1 value1 -option2 value2 ... }
}]
[para]

Following options are available:

[list_begin options]
[opt_def -scope  {base one sub} ]

Control the scope of the search to be one of [const base], [const one], or [const sub],  to  specify  a  base
object,  one-level or  subtree  search.   The  default is [const sub].

[opt_def {-derefaliases} {never search find always}]

Control how aliases dereferencing is done.  Should be one of [const never], [const always], [const search],  or  [const find]  to
specify that aliases are never dereferenced, always dereferenced, dereferenced when searching, or
dereferenced only when locating the base object for the search.
The default is to never dereference aliases.

[opt_def {-sizelimit} num ]

Determines the maximum number of entries to return in a search. If specified as
0 no limit is enforced. The server may enforce a configuration dependent sizelimit,
which may be lower than the one given by this option. The default is 0, no limit.

[opt_def {-timelimit} seconds]

Asks the server to use a timelimit of [arg seconds] for the search. Zero means no
limit. The default is 0, no limit.

[opt_def {-attrsonly} boolean]

If set to 1 only the attribute names but not the values will be present in the search result.
The default is to retrieve attribute names and values.

[opt_def {-referencevar} varname]

If set the search result reference LDAPURIs, if any, are returned in the given variable.
The caller can than decide to follow those references and query other LDAP servers for
further results.

[list_end]
[para]

[call [cmd ::ldap::searchNext] [arg handle]]

This command returns the next entry from a LDAP search initiated
by [cmd ::ldap::searchInit]. It returns only after a new result is received
or when no further results are available, but takes care to keep
the event loop alive.

The returned entry is a list with
two elements: the first is the DN of the entry, the second is the
list of attributes and values, under the format:

[para]
[example {
    dn {attr1 {val11 val12 ...} attr2 {val21...} ...}
}]
[para]

The [cmd ::ldap::searchNext] command returns an empty list at the
end of the search.

[para]

[call [cmd ::ldap::searchEnd] [arg handle]]

This command terminates a LDAP search initiated
by [cmd ::ldap::searchInit]. It also cleans up
the internal state so a new search can be initiated.

If the client has not yet received all results, the client
sends an ABANDON message to inform the server that no
further results for the previous search should to be sent.

[para]

[call [cmd ::ldap::modify] [arg handle] [arg dn] \
	[arg attrValToReplace] \
	[opt [arg attrToDelete]] \
	[opt [arg attrValToAdd]]]

This command modifies the object [arg dn] on the ldap server we are
connected to via [arg handle]. It replaces attributes with new values,
deletes attributes, and adds new attributes with new values.

All arguments are dictionaries mapping attribute names to values. The
optional arguments default to the empty dictionary, which means that
no attributes will be deleted nor added.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def dictionary attrValToReplace in]

No attributes will be changed if this argument is empty. The
dictionary contains the new attributes and their values. They
[emph {replace all}] attributes known to the object.

[arg_def dictionary attrToDelete in]

No attributes will be deleted if this argument is empty. The
dictionary values are restrictions on the deletion. An attribute
listed here will be deleted if and only if its current value at the
server matches the value specified in the dictionary, or if the value
in the dictionary is the empty string.

[arg_def dictionary attrValToAdd in]

No attributes will be added if this argument is empty. The dictionary
values are the values for the new attributes.

[list_end]
[para]

The command blocks until all modifications have completed. Its result
is the empty string.

[call [cmd ::ldap::modifyMulti] [arg handle] [arg dn] \
	[arg attrValToReplace] \
	[opt [arg attrValToDelete]] \
	[opt [arg attrValToAdd]]]

This command modifies the object [arg dn] on the ldap server we are
connected to via [arg handle]. It replaces attributes with new values,
deletes attributes, and adds new attributes with new values.

All arguments are lists with the format:
[para]
[example {
    attr1 {val11 val12 ...} attr2 {val21...} ...
}]
[para]
where each value list may be empty for deleting all attributes.
The optional arguments default to empty lists of attributes to
delete and to add.

[list_begin arguments]
[arg_def list attrValToReplace in]

No attributes will be changed if this argument is empty. The
dictionary contains the new attributes and their values. They
[emph {replace all}] attributes known to the object.

[arg_def list attrValToDelete in]

No attributes will be deleted if this argument is empty. If no
value is specified, the whole set of values for an attribute
will be deleted.

[arg_def list attrValToAdd in]

No attributes will be added if this argument is empty.

[list_end]
[para]

The command blocks until all modifications have completed. Its result
is the empty string.

[call [cmd ::ldap::add] [arg handle] [arg dn] [arg attrValueTuples]]

This command creates a new object using the specified [arg dn]. The
attributes of the new object are set to the values in the list
[arg attrValueTuples].
Multiple valuated attributes may be specified using multiple tuples.

The command blocks until the operation has completed. Its result
is the empty string.

[call [cmd ::ldap::addMulti] [arg handle] [arg dn] [arg attrValueTuples]]

This command is the preferred one to create
a new object using the specified [arg dn]. The
attributes of the new object are set to the values in the dictionary
[arg attrValueTuples] (which is keyed by the attribute names).
Each tuple is a list containing multiple values.

The command blocks until the operation has completed. Its result
is the empty string.

[call [cmd ::ldap::delete] [arg handle] [arg dn]]

This command removes the object specified by [arg dn], and all its
attributes from the server.

The command blocks until the operation has completed. Its result
is the empty string.

[call [cmd ::ldap::modifyDN] [arg handle] [arg dn] [arg newrdn] [opt [arg deleteOld]] [opt [arg newSuperior]]]

This command moves or copies the object specified by [arg dn]
to a new location in the tree of object. This location is
specified by [arg newrdn], a [emph relative] designation,
or by [arg newrdn] and [arg newSuperior], a [emph absolute] designation.

The optional argument [arg deleteOld] defaults to [const true],
i.e. a move operation. If [arg deleteOld] is not set, then the
operation will create a copy of [arg dn] in the new location.

The optional argument [arg newSuperior] defaults an empty string,
meaning that the object must not be relocated in another branch of
the tree. If this argument is given, the argument [arg deleteOld]
must be specified also.

The command blocks until the operation has completed. Its result
is the empty string.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd ip] [arg handle]]

This command returns the IP address of the remote LDAP server the handle is connected to.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd bound] [arg handle]]

This command returns 1 if a handle has successfully completed a [cmd ::ldap::bind].
If no bind was done or it failed, a 0 is returned.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd bounduser] [arg handle]]

This command returns the username used in the bind operation if a handle has successfully completed a [cmd ::ldap::bind].
If no bound was done or it failed, an empty string is returned.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd connections] ]

This command returns all currently existing ldap connection handles.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd tls] [arg handle] ]

This command returns 1 if the ldap connection [arg handle] used TLS/SSL for
connection via [cmd ldap::secure_connect] or completed [cmd ldap::starttls], 0 otherwise.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd tlsstatus] [arg handle] ]

This command returns the current security status of an TLS secured
channel. The result is a list of key-value pairs describing the connected
peer (see the [package TLS] package documentation for the returned values).
If the connection is not secured with TLS, an empty list is returned.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd saslmechanisms] [arg handle]]

Return the supported SASL mechanisms advertised by the server. Only valid in a
bound state (anonymous or other).

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd control] [arg handle] ]

Return the supported controls advertised by the server as a list of OIDs. Only valid in a bound state.

This is currently experimental and subject to change.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd extensions] [arg extensions] ]

Returns the supported LDAP extensions as list of OIDs. Only valid in a bound state.

This is currently experimental and subject to change.

[call [cmd ::ldap::info] [cmd whoami] [arg handle]]

Returns authzId for the current connection. This implements the RFC 4532
protocol extension.
