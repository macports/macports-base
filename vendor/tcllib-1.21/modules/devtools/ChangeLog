2013-01-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* transmitter.crt: [Bug 3433470] Regenerated the certificates,
	* transmitter.key: again. Expiry is Jan 2023 (10 years).
	* receiver.crt: While SimpleCA doesn't seem to allow me to
	* receiver.key: specify a longer period in the GUI it was possible
	* ca.crt: to get, update and run the Tcl code, unwrapped.
	* ca.key: Further changed to 4096-bit certs.

2011-11-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Fixed typos, one still breaking 'testsNeed'.

2011-11-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Fixed 'testsNeed' command to require the
	  needed package and abort properly when it is not found.

	* transmitter.crt: [Bug 3433470] Regenerated the certificates.
	* transmitter.key: Expiry is Nov 2012. SimpleCA doesn't seem
	* receiver.crt: to allow me to specify a longer period. :(
	* receiver.key: Updated README.
	* ca.crt:
	* ca.key:
	* README:

2011-11-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added new constraint to identify core version
	  upto Tcl 8.5, but not higher.

2011-01-20  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl (useTcllibC): Account for the possibility of
	  the environment providing a tcllibc, instead of a Tcllib local
	  one.

2011-01-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl (snitTooManyArgs): Fixed error messages for
	  snit 1.x series.

2010-09-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* testutilities.tcl: [Bug 3066026]: Moved the tcltest
	compatibility initialization into a procedure (InitializeTcltest)
	which is called by testNeedsTcltest and a few other places to be
	done only after we are sure that the tcltest package is present.

2010-03-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added constraint for 8.4-.

2009-09-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added constraint for 8.6+.

2009-04-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* dialog.tcl: Extended to allow dialog over a socket secured by
	  SSL (via package tls).

2009-04-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ca.crt: New files, SSL/TLS certificates for use in testsuites.
	* ca.key: ca.* = Tcllib Certification Authority
	* ca.key.password: Receiver, Transmitter = Certificates for two
	* receiver.crt: sides of a communication channel.
	* receiver.key:
	* transmitter.crt:
	* transmitter.key:

	* README: Acknowledgement added for the SimpleCA software used to
	  create the certificates.

2008-09-20  Michael Schlenker <mic42@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutitlites.tcl: Added wrong num args error messages for
	  Tcl 8.6 alphas, to make tests pass.

2007-04-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* testutilities.tcl: Made TestFiles 8.2-ready. Added command
	  'TestFilesGlob' to simply return files instead of immediately
	  sourcing them.

2007-04-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added 'TestFiles', a command to run a set of
	  subordinate test files, found by globbing.

	* testutilities.tcl: Added 'useAccel' to help with the setup of
	  packages which have accelerators, automatically using the proper
	  use variant.

2006-10-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Extended with three commands to make testing
	  of packages with multiple implementations (accelerators)
	  easier. A specific API for querying and manipulating
	  accelerators is assumed.

2006-10-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Changed variable definitions to shield
	  against creative writing. Added common code to save and restore
	  the environment (::env), for testsuites which have to (1) either
	  modify it as part of the tests, or (2) shield themselves against
	  manipulation from the environment.

2006-09-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dialog.tcl: Bugfix in 'Input', cleaning up the waiting timer
	  when reaching eof on the socket. Could otherwise trigger
	  while executing an unrelated future dialog. Extended to manage
	  two traces, the new one a condensed form of the existing trace,
	  easier to put into the result of a testcase.

	* coserv.tcl: Reworked a bit to allow the restart of a server
	  after a shutdown, by recreating the helper file executed by the
	  slave-process.

2006-09-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Modified use commands to ensure that their
	  output is a proper list.

2006-09-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added commands constructing wrong#args
	  messages for snit methods, depending on snit version.

2006-09-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Ensure that the makeFile/Dir wrapper are
	  created only once. Also modified the code to modify the
	  originals to return the full name. The wrapper are needed only
	  as indicators.

2006-04-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added set of commands for the easy assembly
	  of complex results. Mainly a shorthand for 'lappend', using a
	  common variable.

2006-01-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Force re-import of tcltest commands after
	  changes made by the support system. Added code forcing a useful
	  result value of makeFile/makeDirectory even for Tcltest 1.x
	  (path created instead of list of all paths). Command for the
	  creation of a binary temp. file, and a command to return the
	  path of temp files without us having to create them.

	* coserv.tcl: Fixed usage of temp. files by comm server.

	* coserv.tcl: Fixed output for a better fit with the other test
	* dialog.tcl: support.

2006-01-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added variants of the use commands which keep
	  the relevant namespace. Sometimes necessary to prevent
	  destruction of support code loaded first.

2006-01-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Added commands for the loading of files and
	  packages from the Tcllib under test. This will reduce the amount
	  of boilerplate in a .test file spent on getting the package
	  under test, its supporting packages, and other helper files.

	  Added helpers for dealing with loading "tcllibc" package and
	  packages using it.

2006-01-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: Moved the definitions of the common
	  constraints out of the toplevel "all.tcl" into the test support
	  code.

2006-01-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* testutilities.tcl: New file for boilerplate code and common
	  commands used by most to all testsuites in Tcllib.

2005-10-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.8 ========================
	*

2004-10-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* dialog.tcl: More log output for better tracing of the
	  internals. Especially added trace when receiving an incomplete
	  line while waiting for data from the peer. Added code to clean
	  up old connections, prevent leakage of channel handles.

2004-10-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* muserv.tcl:  Removed the old facilities for sub processes
	* musub.tcl:   and programmed interactions. They have been
	* subserv.tcl: superceded by the code below.

	* coserv.tcl: New sub process mgmt based on "comm".
	* dialog.tcl: New code for programmed dialogs based on
	  "coserv.tcl".

2004-10-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.7 ========================
	*

2004-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6.1 ========================
	*

2004-02-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.6 ========================
	*

2003-05-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	*
	* Released and tagged Tcllib 1.4 ========================
	*

2003-05-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* subserv.tcl (muserv): Propagate the auto_path into the
	  subprocess so that it is able to find all packages the server
	  might require. Without that the server will need an installed
	  tcllib, for example. This fixes a hang in the pop3 testsuite
	  when tcllib is not installed.

2003-04-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* New module.
	* First contents are support for sub-processes in testsuites.
