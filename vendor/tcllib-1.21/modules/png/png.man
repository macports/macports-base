This package provides commands to query and modify PNG images. PNG
stands for [term {Portable Network Graphics}] and is specified at
[uri http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2].

[section COMMANDS]
[list_begin definitions]
[call [cmd ::png::validate] [arg file]]

Returns a value indicating if [arg file] is a valid PNG file. The file
is checked for PNG signature, each chunks checksum is verified,
existence of a data chunk is verified, first chunk is checked for
header, last chunk is checked for ending. Things [emph not] checked
for are: validity of values within a chunk, multiple header chunks,
noncontiguous data chunks, end chunk before actual eof. This procedure
can take lots of time.

[para]
Possible return values:

[list_begin definitions]
[def OK]
File is a valid PNG file.
[def SIG]
no/broken PNG signature.
[def BADLEN]
corrupt chunk length.
[def EOF]
premature end of file.
[def NOHDR]
missing header chunk.
[def CKSUM]
crc mismatch.
[def NODATA]
missing data chunk(s).
[def NOEND]
missing end marker.
[list_end]

[call [cmd ::png::isPNG] [arg file]]

Returns a boolean value indicating if the file [arg file] starts with
a PNG signature. This is a much faster and less intensive check than
[cmd ::png::validate] as it does not check if the PNG data is valid.

[call [cmd ::png::imageInfo] [arg file]]

Returns a dictionary with keys [const width], [const height],

[const depth], [const color], [const compression], [const filter], and
[const interlace]. The values are the associated properties of the PNG
image in [arg file].

Throws an error if file is not a PNG image, or if the checksum of the
header is invalid. For information on interpreting the values for the
returned properties see

[uri http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html].

[call [cmd ::png::getTimestamp] [arg file]]

Returns the epoch time if a timestamp chunk is found in the PNG image
contained in the [arg file], otherwise returns the empty string. Does
not attempt to verify the checksum of the timestamp chunk.

Throws an error if the [arg file] is not a valid PNG image.

[call [cmd ::png::setTimestamp] [arg file] [arg time]]

Writes a new timestamp to the [arg file], either replacing the old
timestamp, or adding one just before the data chunks if there was no
previous timestamp. [arg time] is the new time in the gmt epoch
format.

Throws an error if [arg file] is not a valid PNG image.

[call [cmd ::png::getComments] [arg file]]

Currently supports only uncompressed comments. Does not attempt to
verify the checksums of the comment chunks. Returns a list where each
element is a comment. Each comment is itself a list. The list for a
plain text comment consists of 2 elements: the human readable keyword,
and the text data. A unicode (international) comment consists of 4
elements: the human readable keyword, the language identifier, the
translated keyword, and the unicode text data.

Throws an error if [arg file] is not a valid PNG image.

[call [cmd ::png::removeComments] [arg file]]

Removes all comments from the PNG image in [arg file]. Beware - This
uses memory equal to the file size minus comments, to hold the
intermediate result.

Throws an error if [arg file] is not a valid PNG image.

[call [cmd ::png::addComment] [arg file] [arg keyword] [arg text]]

Adds a plain [arg text] comment to the PNG image in [arg file], just
before the first data chunk. Will throw an error if no data chunk is
found. [arg keyword] has to be less than 80 characters long to conform
to the PNG specification.

[call [cmd ::png::addComment] [arg file] [arg keyword] [arg lang] [arg keyword2] [arg text]]

Adds a unicode (international) comment to the PNG image in [arg file],
just before the first data chunk. Will throw an error if no data chunk
is found. [arg keyword] has to be less than 80 characters long to
conform to the PNG specification. [arg keyword2] is the translated
[arg keyword], in the language specified by the language identifier
[arg lang].

[call [cmd ::png::getPixelDimension] [arg file]]

Returns a dictionary with keys [const ppux], [const ppuy] and
[const unit] if the information is present.  Otherwise, it returns the empty
string.

[para] The values of [const ppux] and [const ppuy] return the pixel
per unit value in X or Y direction.

[para] The allowed values for key [const unit] are [const meter] and
[const unknown]. In the case of meter, the dpi value can be calculated
by multiplying with the conversion factor [const 0.0254].

[call [cmd ::png::image] [arg file]]

Given a PNG file returns the image in the list of scanlines format used by Tk_GetColor.

[call [cmd ::png::write] [arg file] [arg data]]

Takes a list of scanlines in the Tk_GetColor format and writes the represented image
to [arg file].
