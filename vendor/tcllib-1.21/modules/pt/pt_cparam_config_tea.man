This package is an adjunct to [package pt::peg::to::cparam], to make
the use of this highly configurable package easier by providing a
canned configuration. When applied this configuration causes the
package [package pt::peg::to::cparam] to generate plain parser code
ready for inclusion into a [term TEA]-based C extension.

[para]

It is a supporting package in the Core Layer of Parser Tools.

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::pt::cparam::configuration::tea] [method def] \
	[arg name] [arg pkg] [arg version] [arg cmdprefix]]

The command applies the configuration provided by this package to the
[arg cmdprefix], causing the creation of [package tea]-based parsers
whose class is [arg name], in package [arg pkg] with [arg version].

[para]

The use of a command prefix as API allows application of the
configuration to not only [package pt::peg::to::cparam]
([cmd {pt::peg::to::cparam configure}]), but also export manager
instances and PEG containers ([cmd {$export configuration set}] and
[cmd {[$container exporter] configuration set}] respectively).

[para]

Or anything other command prefix accepting two arguments, option and
value.
