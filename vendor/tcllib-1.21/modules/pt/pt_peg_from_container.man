This package does not exist.

There is no need for it.

The CONTAINER format for parsing expression grammars is a piece of Tcl
code which, then sourced, provides a class whose instances have the
grammar we wish to import loaded.

Another way of looking at this is, the CONTAINER output is its own
import package.
