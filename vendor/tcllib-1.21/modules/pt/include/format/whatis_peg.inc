[const peg], a language for the specification of parsing expression
grammars is meant to be human readable, and writable as well, yet
strict enough to allow its processing by machine. Like any computer
language. It was defined to make writing the specification of a
grammar easy, something the other formats found in the Parser Tools do
not lend themselves too.
