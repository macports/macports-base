The PARAM code representation of parsing expression grammars is
assembler-like text using the instructions of the virtual machine
documented in the [manpage {PackRat Machine Specification}], plus a
few more for control flow (jump ok, jump fail, call symbol, return).

[para]

It is not really useful, except possibly as a tool demonstrating how a
grammar is compiled in general, without getting distracted by the
incidentials of a framework, i.e. like the supporting C and Tcl code
generated by the other PARAM-derived formats.
