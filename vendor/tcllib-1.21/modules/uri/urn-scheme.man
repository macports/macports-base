[description]

This package provides two commands to quote and unquote the disallowed
characters for url using the [term urn] scheme, registers the scheme
with the package [package uri], and provides internal helpers which
will be automatically used by the commands [cmd uri::split] and
[cmd uri::join] of package [package uri] to handle urls using the
[term urn] scheme.

[call [cmd uri::urn::quote] [arg url]]

This command quotes the characters disallowed by the [term urn] scheme
(per RFC 2141 sec2.2) in the [arg url] and returns the modified url as
its result.

[call [cmd uri::urn::unquote] [arg url]]

This commands performs the reverse of [cmd ::uri::urn::quote]. It
takes an [term urn] url, removes the quoting from all disallowed
characters, and returns the modified urls as its result.
