For [term Unix]-like environments Tcllib comes with the standard set
of files to make

[example {
  ./configure
  make install
}]

a suitable way of installing it.

This is a standard non-interactive install automatically figuring out
where to place everything, i.e. packages, applications, and the
manpages.

[para] To get a graphical installer invoke

[example {
  ./installer.tcl
}]

instead.
