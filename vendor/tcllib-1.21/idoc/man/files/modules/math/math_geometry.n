.\" The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
.\" in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
.\"
.\" .AP type name in/out ?indent?
.\"	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
.\"	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
.\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
.\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
.\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
.\"
.\" .AS ?type? ?name?
.\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
.\"	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
.\"	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
.\"
.\" .BS
.\"	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
.\"	enclosed in one large box.
.\"
.\" .BE
.\"	End of box enclosure.
.\"
.\" .CS
.\"	Begin code excerpt.
.\"
.\" .CE
.\"	End code excerpt.
.\"
.\" .VS ?version? ?br?
.\"	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
.\"	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
.\"	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
.\"	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
.\"	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
.\"
.\" .VE
.\"	End of vertical sidebar.
.\"
.\" .DS
.\"	Begin an indented unfilled display.
.\"
.\" .DE
.\"	End of indented unfilled display.
.\"
.\" .SO ?manpage?
.\"	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
.\"	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
.\"	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
.\"	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
.\"
.\" .SE
.\"	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
.\"
.\" .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
.\"	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
.\"	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
.\"	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
.\"	the option's class in the option database.
.\"
.\" .UL arg1 arg2
.\"	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
.\"
.\" .QW arg1 ?arg2?
.\"	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
.\"
.\" .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
.\"	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
.\"	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBmath::geometry\fR package is a collection of functions for
computations and manipulations on two-dimensional geometrical objects,
such as points, lines and polygons\&.
.PP
The geometrical objects are implemented as plain lists of coordinates\&.
For instance a line is defined by a list of four numbers, the x- and
y-coordinate of a first point and the x- and y-coordinates of a second
point on the line\&.
.PP
\fINote:\fR In version 1\&.4\&.0 an inconsistency was repaired - see \fIhttps://core\&.tcl-lang\&.org/tcllib/tktview?name=fb4812f82b\fR\&.
More in \fBCOORDINATE SYSTEM\fR
.PP
The various types of object are recognised by the number of coordinate
pairs and the context in which they are used: a list of four elements
can be regarded as an infinite line, a finite line segment but also
as a polyline of one segment and a point set of two points\&.
.PP
Currently the following types of objects are distinguished:
.IP \(bu
\fIpoint\fR - a list of two coordinates representing the x- and
y-coordinates respectively\&.
.IP \(bu
\fIline\fR - a list of four coordinates, interpreted as the x- and
y-coordinates of two distinct points on the line\&.
.IP \(bu
\fIline segment\fR - a list of four coordinates, interpreted as the
x- and y-coordinates of the first and the last points on the line
segment\&.
.IP \(bu
\fIpolyline\fR - a list of an even number of coordinates,
interpreted as the x- and y-coordinates of an ordered set of points\&.
.IP \(bu
\fIpolygon\fR - like a polyline, but the implicit assumption is that
the polyline is closed (if the first and last points do not coincide,
the missing segment is automatically added)\&.
.IP \(bu
\fIpoint set\fR - again a list of an even number of coordinates, but
the points are regarded without any ordering\&.
.IP \(bu
\fIcircle\fR - a list of three numbers, the first two are the coordinates of the
centre and the third is the radius\&.
.PP
.SH PROCEDURES
The package defines the following public procedures:
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::+\fR \fIpoint1\fR \fIpoint2\fR
Compute the sum of the two vectors given as points and return it\&.
The result is a vector as well\&.
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::-\fR \fIpoint1\fR \fIpoint2\fR
Compute the difference (point1 - point2) of the two vectors
given as points and return it\&. The result is a vector as well\&.
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::p\fR \fIx\fR \fIy\fR
Construct a point from its coordinates and return it as the
result of the command\&.
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::distance\fR \fIpoint1\fR \fIpoint2\fR
Compute the distance between the two points and return it as the
result of the command\&. This is in essence the same as
.CS


    math::geometry::length [math::geomtry::- point1 point2]

.CE
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::length\fR \fIpoint\fR
Compute the length of the vector and return it as the
result of the command\&.
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::s*\fR \fIfactor\fR \fIpoint\fR
Scale the vector by the factor and return it as the
result of the command\&. This is a vector as well\&.
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::direction\fR \fIangle\fR
Given the angle in degrees this command computes and returns
the unit vector pointing into this direction\&. The vector for
angle == 0 points to the right (east), and for angle == 90 up (north)\&.
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::h\fR \fIlength\fR
Returns a horizontal vector on the X-axis of the specified length\&.
Positive lengths point to the right (east)\&.
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::v\fR \fIlength\fR
Returns a vertical vector on the Y-axis of the specified length\&.
Positive lengths point down (south)\&.
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::between\fR \fIpoint1\fR \fIpoint2\fR \fIs\fR
Compute the point which is at relative distance \fIs\fR between the two
points and return it as the result of the command\&. A relative distance of
\fB0\fR returns \fIpoint1\fR, the distance \fB1\fR returns \fIpoint2\fR\&.
Distances < 0 or > 1 extrapolate along the line between the two point\&.
.TP
\fB::math::geometry::octant\fR \fIpoint\fR
Compute the octant of the circle the point is in and return it as the result
of the command\&. The possible results are

Check whether two polylines intersect, but reduce

consisting of granularity points each\&. If a pair of those smaller
lines' bounding boxes intersect, then this procedure returns 1,

.SH "COORDINATE SYSTEM"
The coordinate system used by the package is the ordinary cartesian system, where the
positive x-axis is directed to the right and the positive y-axis is directed upwards\&.
Angles and directions are defined with respect to the positive x-axis in a counter-clockwise
direction, so that an angle of 90 degrees is the direction of the positive y-axis\&.
Note that the Tk canvas coordinates differ from this, as there the origin is located in the
upper left corner of the window\&. Up to and including version 1\&.3, the direction and octant
procedures of this package used this convention inconsistently\&.
