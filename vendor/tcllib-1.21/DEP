Deprecations in Tcllib 1.21
===========================

Four packages are stage 2 deprecated in favor of two replacements.
All internal users of the deprecated packages have been rewritten to
use their replacements.

    Module             Package           Replacement      Deprecation stage
    ------------------ ----------------- ---------------- --------------------------------
    doctools           doctools::paths   fileutil::paths  (D2) Attempts to use throw errors
    doctools           doctools::config  struct::map      (D2) Attempts to use throw errors
    pt                 paths             fileutil::paths  (D2) Attempts to use throw errors
    pt                 configuration     struct::map      (D2) Attempts to use throw errors
    ------------------ ----------------- ---------------- --------------------------------

Stage 2 (D2) means that:

  - The deprecated packages still exist.
  - Their implementations have changed and throw errors.

Future progress:

  - In the release after 1.21 the stage 2 deprecated packages will be
    moved to stage 3 (D3). In that stage the packages will be removed
    from Tcllib, causing `package require` to fail.
