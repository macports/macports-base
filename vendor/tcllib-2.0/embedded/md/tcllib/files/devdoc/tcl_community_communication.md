The Tcl Community encourages contributions from anyone who wishes to advance the
development of:

  - The Tcl Language

  - Tcl derived languages

  - Tcl related libraries

  - Tcl extensions

  - External Projects that Integrate Tcl

We welcome those contributions from anyone\. We are blind to gender, race,
religion, cultural background, cybernetic nature, and any other demographic
characteristics, as well as personal political views\.

A community lives and dies by communications\. And occasionally our
communications are peppered with patterns that are harsh, unfriendly,
unwelcoming and/or otherwise unkind\. As a volunteer community, we need all of
the help we can get\. Therefore, we ask all contributors to make a conscious
effort, in Tcl Community discussions, to communicate in ways that are welcoming\.
Ways that are friendly\. Ways that are, in a word: kind\.

These guidelines suggest specific ways to accomplish that goal\.

Please note: for the balance of this document any reference to "People",
"Persons", "anybody" or "somebody" can refer to any sentient being, not merely
corporeal members of the species Homo Sapien\.

  - We are a Sanctuary not a Clubhouse

    The Tcl Community is a collective of amateurs and professionals who code,
    test, and use tools\. Our community is open to all\. There is no velvet rope\.
    There is no bouncer at the door\. There are no secret handshakes\. Any
    sentient being who enters our midst is welcome\. If someone is ever asked to
    leave, it is only because they are being disruptive to the functioning of
    the community\.

  - We Merit Ideas, Not People

    A good idea can come from anyone, regardless of how little time they have
    been with us\. A bad idea can come from anyone, regardless of how much time
    or how little time they have been with us\. We judge a concept by how it
    stands up to scrutiny of logic, implementation, and regression testing\. We
    don’t judge ideas based on who had the idea first, who agrees with the idea,
    or who disagrees with it\.

  - Treat Everyone with Respect

    Everyone is deserving of respect and courtesy at all times\.

  - Refer to people by the names they use\.

    If grammar requires you to state a gender for a person, honor their
    preferences about their gender identity\. If you are unsure as to the gender
    of an individual, ask\. If someone had to guess about your gender and got it
    wrong, please correct them and do not take it personally\.

  - Do not take a harsh tone towards other participants\.

    Do not make personal attacks against anyone \(participant or not\.\)

    Criticize statements and actions, never people\.

  - Don’t Take Things Personally

    When in doubt, assume the best in people\. A criticism of your statements is
    not a personal attack on you\.

  - Persons, not People

    Stereotypes are an unhelpful tool on many accounts\. They are generally
    oversimplified\. They are usually flat out wrong\. And even if "right" they
    are of absolutely no utility in determining the capabilities, motivations,
    or fitness of an individual\.

    Don’t use them in Tcl Community communications\.

  - Mistakes Happen

    The human condition is a series of trials and errors\. Progress is when we
    get one more trial than error\. Being wrong or making a mistake is the
    default state of humanity\. Accept the errors of your fellow sentient beings,
    and be aware that you are also fallible\.

  - Keep it Real

    Please respond to what people actually say\. We are all amazing individuals,
    but none among us are mind readers\. If you find yourself responding to what
    you imagine someone is thinking, odds are you are going to be wrong\.

    If you must criticize someone, stick to things they have actually done\.
    Never criticize for something you speculate they have done\. Or imagine they
    have done\. Or something someone who shares some attribute with them has done
    in the past\.

    Keep discussions about any non\-Tcl subjects to what can be stated factually
    and without emotion or judgement\.

  - When Trouble Arises, Don’t Escalate

    If you feel you are being personally attacked or offended, take the high
    road\. Punching back in a public forum will only makes things worse\. Address
    the matter in a private correspondence\. Be polite\. Express your feelings,
    but note that you are expressing your feelings\. When writing, look for a way
    to calm matters down\. And when in doubt, sleep on your letter before
    pressing send\. And when not in doubt, sleep on it for another day after
    that\.

    If you are a spectator to a fight in progress, politely request the two
    parties take the matter to a more private forum\.

  - Always get the Last Word: I’m Sorry

    If an personal argument does arise, be the first to apologize\. An apology
    does not concede a logical point\. It merely acknowledges that at some point
    the discussion left either logic, community decency, or both\. Return to the
    topic when cooler heads can prevail\.

  - Nobody is Keeping Score

    There is no prize for being right\. There is no cost for being wrong\. A hard
    sell is not going to advance your idea along any more than a logical
    argument\. You aren’t running for office\. This isn’t debate club\. If you find
    yourself continuing a discussion beyond where a topic can be logically
    discussed, stop\.

  - No Evangelizing

    The Tcl Community is not the place to promote your chosen operating system,
    political outlook, religion, marketing scheme, or economic model\. Period\.

    \(And if you do bring it up, be prepared to have your chosen topic discussed
    logically\. And odds are, not favorably\.\)

  - Respect the Community

    If the Community has come to a decision on a course of action, please stop
    arguing\.

    If someone complains about how you are expressing your ideas, listen\.

    If your words are hurting people, stop\. There is no amount of being "right"
    that makes up for someone leaving our midst because they felt insulted,
    threatened, or ignored\.

By following these guidelines, we will build our community, encourage more
contribution to our projects, and our discussions will be friendlier and reach
conclusions more easily\.

Thank You\.
