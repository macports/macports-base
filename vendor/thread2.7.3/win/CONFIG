# This is how I run configure.  You'll want to change the
# pathnames to match your system, of course.
#
# Remember that if you use the --enable-sybols, you need to
# use the thread25d.dll in a tclsh that has also been compiled
# with symbols (e.g., tclsh84g.exe or tclsh84d.exe).
# If you want to build both debug and non-debug versions, then
# create "debug" and "release" directories and run configure
# from in those directories with the appropriate flags.
#
# Note the CC=gcc must be set *before* the "configure" is ran.
# This is really needed, otherwise configure will not be able
# to compile the small test file which checks the presence
# of the MinGW build environment. It is *not* enough to use
# "--enable-gcc" configure option; you *need* to define CC.
# 

export CC=gcc
sh ../configure --enable-threads --with-tcl=e:/tcl/win
