2003-12-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (DllMain): Add HAVE_NO_SEH blocks in place of
	__try and __except statements to support gcc builds. This is needed
	after David's changes on 2003-12-21. [Patch 858493]

2003-12-23  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclAlloc.c:	All uses of 'panic' (the macro) changed to
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	'Tcl_Panic' (the function). The #define of
	* generic/tclBinary.c:	panic in tcl.h clearly states it is deprecated
	* generic/tclCkalloc.c:	in the comments. [Patch 865264]
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:

	Tcl_Alloc in the TclAllocObjStorage macro.

2003-12-22  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/nmakehlp.c:
	* win/rules.vc:  New feature for extensions that use rules.vc. Now
	reads header files for version strings. No more hard coding
	TCL_VERSION = 8.5 and having to edit it when you swap cores.

	* win/makefile.vc: VERSION macro now set by reading tcl.h for it.

	* generic/tcl.h: Removed note that makefile.vc needs to have a version
	number changed.

2003-12-21  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: Structured Exception Handling added around
	Tcl_Finalize called from DllMain's DLL_PROCESS_DETACH. We can't be
	100% assured that Tcl is being unloaded by the OS in a stable
	condition and we need to protect the exit handlers should the stack be
	in a hosed state. AT&T style assembly for SEH under MinGW has not been
	added yet. This is a first part change for [Patch 858493]

2003-12-17  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBinary.c (DeleteScanNumberCache): fixed crashing bug when
	numeric scan-value cache contains NULL value.

2003-12-17  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* tests/fCmd.test:
	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* doc/file.n: final fix to support for relative links and its
	implications on normalization and other parts of the filesystem code.
	Fixes [Bug 859251] and some Windows problems with recursive file
	delete/copy and symbolic links.

2003-12-17  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c:
	* tests/fileSystem.test: fix and tests for [Bug 860402] in new file
	normalization code.

2003-12-17  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zv@archiware.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fixed 2 memory (object) leaks. [Bug 839519]

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: fixed Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath to always return
	properly refcounted path object. [Bug 861515]

2003-12-16  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fCmd.test: marking fCmd-9.14.2, as nonPortable, since on
	Solaris one can change the name of the current directory with 'file
	rename'.
	* doc/FileSystem.3: clarified documentation on ownership of return
	objects/strings of some Tcl_FS* calls.

2003-12-16  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (binfo): Made variable file-local.

2003-12-15  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tcl.rc:
	* win/tclsh.rc: Slight modification to the STRINGIFY macro to support
	Borland's rc tool.

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpUtime) : utimbuf struct not a problem with
	Borland.

	* win/tclWinTime.c (TclpGetDate) : Borland's localtime() has a slight
	behavioral difference.

	From Helmut Giese <hgiese@ratiosoft.com> [Patch 758097].

2003-12-14  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclInt.decls: commented-out entry for TclpCheckStackSpace,
	removing it from the Stubs table. It's already declared in tclInt.h
	and labeled as a function that is not to be exported. Regened tables.

2003-12-14  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SwitchObjCmd): TIP#75 Implementation
	* tests/switch.test:	Can now get submatch information when using
	* doc/switch.n:		-regexp matching in [switch].

2003-12-14  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: complete rewrite of generic file normalization
	code to cope with links followed by '..'. [Bug 849514], and parts of
	[Bug 859251]

2003-12-12  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c: Win32's SetFilePointer() takes LONGs not DWORDs (a
	signed/unsigned mismatch). Redid local vars to avoid all casting
	except where truly required.

2003-12-12  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c: fix to normalization of non-existent user name
	('file normalize ~nobody') [Bug 858937]
	* doc/file.n: clarify behaviour of 'file link' when the target is not
	an absolute path.
	* doc/filename.n: correct documentation to say that Windows Tcl does
	handle '~user', for recent Windows releases, and clarified distinction
	between MacOS 'classic' and MacOS X.
	* doc/glob.n: clarification of glob's behaviour when returning
	filenames starting with a '~'.

	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* tests/fileName.test: new tests added for the normalization problem
	above and other recentlt reported issues.

	* win/tclWinFile.c: corrected unclear comments

	* unix/tclUnixFile.c: allow creation of relative links. [Bug 833713]

2003-12-11  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinSock.c (SocketThreadExitHandler) : added a TerminateThread
	fallback just in case the socket handler thread is really in a paused
	state. This can happen when Tcl is being unloaded by the OS from an
	exception handler. See MSDN docs on DllMain, it states this behavior.

2003-12-09  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: updated OpenBSD build configuration based on
	[Patch #775246] (cassoff)

2003-12-09  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:	#ifdef'd out declarations of errno which are
	* tools/man2tcl.c:	known to cause problems with recent glibc.
				[Bug 852369]

2003-12-09  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: fix to NT file permissions code [Bug 855923]
	* tests/winFile.test: added tests for NT file permissions - patch and
	test scripts supplied by Benny.

	* tests/winFCmd.test: fixed one test for when not running in C:/

2003-12-02  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclBinary.c (DeleteScanNumberCache, ScanNumber): Made the
	numeric scan-value cache have proper references to the objects within
	it so strange patterns of writes won't cause references to freed
	objects. Thanks to Paul Obermeir for the report. [Bug 851747]

2003-12-01  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/lset.n: fix typo [Bug 852224]

2003-11-24  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c:	Corrected faulty check for trailing white
	space in {expand} parsing. Thanks Andreas Leitgeb. [Bug 848262]
	* tests/parse.test: 	New tests for the bug.

2003-11-24  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: fix to [Bug 845778] - Infinite recursion on
	[cd] (Windows only bug), for which new tests have just been added.

2003-11-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winFCmd.test (winFCmd-16.10,11): Merged new tests from
	core-8-4-branch.

2003-11-20  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: fix flag bit collision between LOOKUP_FOR_UPVAR
	and TCL_PARSE_PART1 (deprecated) [Bug 835020]

2003-11-19  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/compile.test (compile-16.22.0):	Improved test for the recent
	fix for Bug 845412.

2003-11-19  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript): Added a guard for the
	expansion code so that long non-expanding commands don't get expansion
	infrastructure inserted in them, especially when that infrastructure
	isn't initialised. [Bug 845412]

2003-11-18  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* contrib/djgpp/Makefile:		Changes from Victor Wagner
	* contrib/djgpp/langinfo.c (new):	<vitus@45.free.net> for better
	* contrib/djgpp/langinfo.h (new):	DJGPP support.
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c:			.
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c:			.
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:			.

2003-11-17  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/reg.test: Added tests for [Bugs 230589, 504785, 505048, 840258]
	recently fixed by 2003-11-15 commit to regcomp.c by Pavel Goran. His
	notes on the fix: This bug results from an error in code that splits
	states into "progress" and "no-progress" ones. This error causes an
	interesting situation with the pre-collected single-linked list of
	states to be splitted: many items were added to the list, but only
	several of them are accessible from the list beginning, since the
	"tmp" member of struct state (which is used here to hold a pointer to
	the next list item) gets overwritten, which results in a "looped"
	chain. As a result, not all of states are splitted, and one state is
	splitted two times, causing incorrect "no-progress" flag values.

2003-11-16  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Make sure that
	Tcl_AsyncInvoke is called regularly when processing bytecodes.
	* generic/tclTest.c (AsyncThreadProc, TestasyncCmd): Extended testing
	harness to send an asynchronous marking without relying on UNIX
	signals.
	* tests/async.test (async-4.*): Tests to check that async events are
	handled by the bytecode core. [Bug 746722]

2003-11-15  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestHashSystemHashCmd): Removed 'const' modifier
	from hash type structure; it should be const and the hash code assumes
	it behaves like const, but that's not how the API is defined. Like
	this, we are following in the same footsteps as Tcl_RegisterObjType()
	which has the same conditions on its argument. Stops VC++5.2 warning.
	[Bug 842511]

2003-11-14  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclHash.c (Tcl_DeleteHashTable,Tcl_HashStats,RebuildTable):
	* generic/tclTest.c (TestHashSystemHashCmd): TIP#138 implementation,
	* tests/misc.test:	plus a new chunk of stuff to test the hash
				functions more thoroughly in the test suite.
				[Patch 731356, modified]

	* doc/Tcl.n: Updated Tcl version number and changebars.

2003-11-14  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/ParseCmd.3:	Implementation of TIP 157.  Adds recognition
	* doc/Tcl.n:		of the new leading {expand} syntax on words.
	* generic/tcl.h:	Parses such words as the new Tcl_Token type
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	TCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD. Updated Tcl_EvalEx and
	* generic/tclCompile.c: the bytecode compiler/execution engine to
	* generic/tclCompile.h:	recognize the new token type. New opcodes
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	INST_LIST_VERIFY and INST_INVOKE_EXP and a new
	* generic/tclParse.c:	operand type OPERAND_ULIST1 are defined. Docs
	* generic/tclTest.c:	and tests are included.
	* tests/basic.test:
	* tests/compile.test:
	* tests/parse.test:

	* library/auto.tcl:	Replaced several [eval]s used to perform
	* library/package.tcl:	argument expansion with the new syntax. In the
	* library/safe.tcl:	test files lindex.test and lset.test, replaced
	* tests/cmdInfo.test:	use of [eval] to force direct string
	* tests/encoding.test:	evaluation with use of [testevalex] which more
	* tests/execute.test:	directly and robustly serves the same purpose.

2003-11-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/cmdMZ.test (cmdMZ-1.4): change to nonPortable as more systems
	are using permissions caching, and this isn't really a Tcl controlled
	issue.

2003-11-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: improve AIX --enable-64bit handling
	remove -D__NO_STRING_INLINES -D__NO_MATH_INLINES from CFLAGS_OPTIMIZE
	on Linux. Make default opt -O2 (was -O).

2003-11-11  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* contrib/djgpp/Makefile:  Suggested changes from vitus@45.free.net
	(Victor Wagner)

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:  added socklen_t typedef for DJGPP

2003-11-10  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):	Fix for [Bug 832657]
	that should not run afoul of startup constraints.

	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:	Added safeguards so that registry and
	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl:	dde packages are not offered on
	* win/tclWinDde.c:		non-Windows platforms. Bumped to
	* win/tclWinReg.c:		registry 1.1.3 and dde 1.3.
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/configure.in:
	* win/makefile.bc:
	* win/makefile.vc:

	* win/configure:	autoconf (2.57)

2003-11-10  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdIL.test: Stopped cmdIL-5.5 from stomping over the test
	command, and updated the tests to use some tcltest2 features in
	relation to cleanup. [Bug 838384]

2003-11-10  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* tests/fCmd.test: fix to misleading error message in 'file link'.
	[Bug 836208]

2003-11-07  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to compiler warning/error with some
	compilers. [Bug 835918]

2003-11-07  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: optimized builds define NDEBUG to turn off
	ThreadAlloc range checking.

2003-11-05  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.10):  New test to expose [Bug 832657]
	failure of TclpInitLibraryPath() to properly handle .. in the path
	of the executable.

2003-11-04  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: added 'test' target.

2003-11-03  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c
	* generic/tclInt.h: added comments and re-arranged code to clarify
	distinction between Tcl_LoadHandle, ClientData for 'load'ed code, and
	point out limitations of the design introduced with Tcl 8.4.

	* unix/tclUnixFile.c: fix to memory leak

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c: removed warning on Windows.

2003-11-01  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LrepeatObjCmd): Check for sensible list
	lengths and allow for soft failure of the memory subsystem in the
	[lconcat] command [Bug 829027]. Uses direct list creation to avoid
	extra copies when working near the limit of available memory. Also
	reorganized to encourage optimizing compilers to optimize heavily.
	* generic/tclListObj.c (TclNewListObjDirect): New list constructor
	that does not copy the array of objects. Useful for creating
	potentially very large lists or where you are about to throw away the
	array argument which is being used in its entirety.

2003-10-28  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (NEXT_INST macros): replaced macro variable
	"result" by "resultHandling" to avoid confusion.

2003-10-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (Tcl_MakeFileChannel): Applied [Patch 813606]
	fixing [Bug 813087]. Detection of sockets was off for Mac OS X which
	implements pipes as local sockets. The new code ensures that only IP
	sockets are detected as such.

	* win/tclWinSock.c (TcpWatchProc): Watch for FD_CLOSE too when asked
	for writable events by the generic layer.
	(SocketEventProc): Generate a writable event too when a close is
	detected.

	  Together the changes fix [Bug 599468].

2003-10-23  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/resource.test:
	* mac/tclMacResource.c: fix to resource freeing problem in 'resource'
	command reported by Bernard Desgraupes.

	* doc/FileSystem.3: updated documentation for 'glob' fix on 2003-10-13
	below

2003-10-22  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FileObjCmd): Changed FILE_ prefix to FCMD_
	to stop symbol/#def clashes on Cygwin/Mingw32 on NT. [Bug 822528]

2003-10-21   Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: fixed incorrect html generated for
	.IP/.TP lists, now use <DL><DT>...<DD>...<P><DT>...<DD>...</DL>
	instead of illegal  <DL><P><DT>...<DD>...<P><DT>...<DD>...</DL>.
	Added skipping of directives directly after .TP to avoid them being
	used as item descriptions, e.g. .TP\n.VS in clock.n.

2003-10-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Applied the patch coming with
	[Bug 805605] to the code, fixing the incorrect use of ispace noted by
	Ronald Dauster <ronaldd@users.sourceforge.net>.

2003-10-20  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/msgcat.n:
	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl (mclocale,mcload):
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* unix/Makefile.in:     Implementation of TIP#156, add a "root locale"
	* win/makefile.bc:      to the 'msgcat' package. Advanced msgcat
	* win/Makefile.in:      version number to 1.4
	* win/Makefile.vc:

2003-10-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (SortInfo,etc): Reorganized so that SortInfo
	carries an array of integer indices instead of a Tcl list. This nips
	shimmering problems in the bud and simplifies SelectObjFromSublist at
	the cost of making setup slightly more complex. [Bug 823768]

2003-10-14  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclAppInit.c (sigHandler): Punt gracefully if exitToken has
	already been destroyed.

2003-10-14  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* tests/regexp.test: fix to [Bug 823524] in regsub; added three new
	tests.

2003-10-14  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclAppendObjToErrorInfo):	New internal routine
	that appends a Tcl_Obj to the errorInfo, saving the caller the trouble
	of extracting the string rep.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (TclAppendLimitedToObj):	New internal
	routine that supports truncated appends with optional ellipsis marking.
	This single routine supports UTF-8-safe truncated appends needed in
	several places throughout the Tcl source code, mostly for error and
	stack messages. Clean fix for [Bug 760872].

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Declarations for new internal routines.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	Updated callers to use the new routines.
	* generic/tclCompExpr.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c:
	* mac/tclMacResource.c:

	* library/init.tcl:	Updated ::errorInfo cleanup in [unknown] to
	reflect slight modifications to Tcl_LogCommandInfo(). Corrects failing
	init-4.* tests.

2003-10-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	TIP#127 IMPLEMENTATION FROM JOE MICHAEL SCHLENKER

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (SelectObjFromSublist): Element selection engine.
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsearchObjCmd, Tcl_LsortObjCmd):
	* tests/lsearch.test:	Set up and use of element selection engine,
	* tests/cmdIL.test:	plus tests and documentation.
	* doc/lsearch.n:	Based on [Patch 693836]
	* doc/lsort.n:

	Fixed [Bug 800106] in which 'glob' was incapable of merging the
	results of a directory listing (real or virtual) and any virtual
	filesystem mountpoints in that directory (the latter were ignored).
	This meant boundaries between different filesystems were not seamless
	(e.g. 'glob */*' across a filesystem boundary was wrong). Added new
	entry to Tcl_GlobTypeData in a totally backwards compatible way. To
	allow listing of mounts, registered filesystems must support the
	'TCL_GLOB_TYPE_MOUNT' flag. If this is not supported (e.g. in tclvfs
	1.2) then mounts will simply not be listed for that filesystem.

	Fixed [Bug 749876] 'file writable/readable/etc' (NativeAccess) using
	correct permission checking code for Windows NT/2000/XP where more
	complex user-based security/access priveleges are available,
	particularly on shared volumes. The performance impact of this extra
	checking will need further investigation. Note: Win 95,98,ME have no
	support for this.

	Also made better use of normalized rather than translated paths in the
	platform specific code.

	"leave" execution traces, so that all error information of the traced
	command is still available whether traced or not. [Bug 760947]
	Thanks to Yahalom Emet.

2003-10-08  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestNumUtfCharsCmd): Command to allow finer
	access to Tcl_NumUtfChars for testing.
	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_NumUtfChars): Corrected string length
	determining when the length parameter is negative; the terminator is a

2003-09-28  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: The windows port of expect can call

	missing PipeInit() call to make sure the initialization happens.

2003-09-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: ensure SYMROOT exists if OBJROOT is overridden on

2003-09-24  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl (tcl::MacPkgUnknown, tcl::MacOSXPkgUnknown):
	Minor performance tweaks to reduce the number of [file] invocations.

	2000-01-28 fix for [Bug 218871] to all potentially troubled uses of
	[info commands] on input data, where glob-special characters could
	cause problems.

2003-09-20  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/expr.test (expr-23.4): Prevented accidental wrapping round of

	test either. [Bug 808244]

2003-09-19  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: adding (DE)CACHE_STACK_INFO() pairs to protect

2003-09-17  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	[Bug 803968]

2003-09-08  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinLoad.c (TclpDlopen): Changed the error message for
	ERROR_PROC_NOT_FOUND to be a bit more helpful in giving us clues.
	"can't find specified procedure" means a function in the import table,
	for implicit loading, couldn't be resolved and that's why the load
	failed.

2003-09-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Tcl_Main.3:
	* doc/FileSystem.3:				Implementation of
	* doc/source.n:					TIPs 137/151. Adds a
	* doc/tclsh.1:					-encoding option to
	* generic/tcl.decls:				the [source] command
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SourceObjCmd):	and a new C routine,
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSEvalFileEx):	Tcl_FSEvalFileEx(),
	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_Main):			that provides C access
	* mac/tclMacResource.c (Tcl_MacSourceObjCmd):	to the same function.
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:				Also adds command line
	* tests/main.test:	option handling in Tcl_Main() so that tclsh
	* tests/source.test:	and other apps built on Tcl_Main() respect a
	-encoding command line option before a script filename. Docs and tests
	updated as well. [Patch 742683]
	This is a ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** only for those C programs
	that embed Tcl, build on Tcl_Main(), and make use of Tcl_Main's former
	ability to pass a leading "-encoding" option to interactive shell
	operations.

	* generic/tclInt.decls:				Added internal stub
	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl*StartupScript*):	table entries for two
	new functions Tcl_SetStartupScript() and Tcl_GetStartupScript() that
	set/get the path and encoding for the startup script to be evaluated
	by either Tcl_Main() or Tk_Main(). Given public names in anticipation
	of their exposure by a followup TIP.

	* generic/tclDecls.h:		make genstubs
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:

2003-09-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/SplitList.3:	Implementation of TIP 148.  Fixes [Bug 489537].
	* generic/tcl.h:	Updated Tcl_ConvertCountedElement() to quote
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	the leading "#" character of all list elements
	unless the TCL_DONT_QUOTE_HASH flag is passed in.

	* generic/tclDictObj.c:	Updated Tcl_ConvertCountedElement() callers
	* generic/tclListObj.c:	to pass in the TCL_DONT_QUOTE_HASH flags
	* generic/tclResult.c:	when appropriate.

2003-08-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/return.n:	Updated [return] docs to cover new TIP 90 features.

	* doc/break.n:		Added SEE ALSO references to return.n
	* doc/continue.n:

2003-09-01  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/Namespace.3: Basic documentation for the TIP#139 functions. This
	will need improving, but the basic bits are there at least.

2003-08-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/catch.n:	Updated [catch] docs to cover new TIP 90 features.

2003-08-29  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:	Corrected bug in TIP 90 implementation where
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:	the default -errorcode NONE value was not
	copied into the return options dictionary. This correction modified
	one test result.

2003-08-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* compat/strftime.c (_fmt): Removed syst array intializer that
	couldn't take variables within it under the watcom compiler:
	'Initializers must be constant'. I believe Borland has this strictness
	as well. VC++ must be non-standard about this.

	Changed Win32 platform #ifdef from 'WIN32' to '__WIN32__' as this is
	the correct one to use across the Tcl sources. Even though we do force
	it in tcl.h, the true parent one is __WIN32__.

	Added missing CONST'ification usage to match prototype listed in
	tclInt.decls.

	* win/tclWinPort.h:  Added a block for OpenWatcom adjustments that
	fixes 1) the same issue Mo did for MinGW lack of missing LPFN_*
	typedefs in their WINE derived <winsock2.h> and 2) The need to be
	strict about how the char type needs to be signed by default.

	* win/tclWinSock.c:  Added OpenWatcom to the commentary about the
	#ifdef HAVE_NO_LPFN_DECLS block.

	* win/tclWinTime.c:  Changed use of '_timezone' to 'timezone' as this
	difference is already adjusted for in tclWinPort.h. Removed
	unreferenced posixEpoch file-scope global.

	* win/tclWinFile.c (WinReadLinkDirectory): Fix for 'Initializers must
	be constant' with the driveSpec array using OpenWatcom.

2003-08-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c:	Corrected [Bug 411825] and other bugs in
	TclNeedSpace() where non-breaking space (\u00A0) and backslash-escaped
	spaces were handled incorrectly.
	* tests/util.test:	Added new tests util-8.[2-6].

2003-08-26  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tcl.h: Added some support for the LCC-Win32 compiler.
	Unfortunetly, this compiler has a bug in its preprocessor and can't
	build Tcl even with this minor patch. Also added some support for the
	OpenWatcom compiler. A new win/makefile.wc to follow soon.

2003-08-25  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl (genStubs::makeDecl): A more subtle way of
	generating stubbed declarations allows us to have declarations of a
	function in multiple interfaces simultaneously.

	* generic/tcl.decls: Duplicated some namespace declarations from
	tclInt.decls here, as mandated by TIP #139. This is OK since the
	declarations match and will end up using the declarations in the
	public code from now on because of #include ordering. Keeping the old
	declarations in tclInt.decls; there's no need to gratuitously break
	compatibility for those extensions which are already clients of the
	namespace code.

2003-08-23  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiwrae.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: merged fixes for thread-unsafe handling of
	filesystem records [Bug 753315]. This also fixed the [Bug 788780]
	* generic/tclPathObj.c: merged fixes for thread-unsafe handling of
	filesystem records. [Bug 753315]

	* generic/tclFileSystem.h: merged fixes for thread-unsafe handling of
	filesystem records. [Bug 753315]

2003-08-19  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialErrorStr): Fixed a syntax error created in
	the previous code cleanup.

2003-08-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Adjusted commenting and spacing usage to follow
	the principles of the Style Guide better.

2003-08-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS): Use test instead of -eq, which does
	not work. [Bug 781109]

2003-08-13  Chengye Mao <chengye.geo@yahoo.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: fixed a bug in BuildCommandLine. This bug built a
	command line with a missing space between tclpipe.dll and the
	following arguments. It caused error in Windows 98 when exec
	command.com (e.g. dir). [Bug 789040]

2003-08-11  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	TIP #136 IMPLEMENTATION from Simon Geard <simon.geard@ntlworld.com>
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LrepeatObjCmd): Adapted version of Simon's
	* doc/lrepeat.n:			  patch, updated to the HEAD
	* tests/lrepeat.test:			  and matching the core style.
	* generic/tclBasic.c (buildIntCmds):	Splice into core.
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* doc/list.n:				Cross-reference.

2003-08-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinInit.c: recognize amd64 and ia32_on_win64 cpus.

2003-08-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:	Added escape so that non-Windows
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl:	platforms do not try to use the
	registry package. This can save a costly and pointless package search.
	Bumped to 1.3.1. Thanks to Dave Bodenstab. [Bug 781609]

2003-08-05  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_INVOKE, INST_EVAL, INST_PUSH_RESULT):
	added a Tcl_ResetResult(interp) at each point where the interp's
	result is pushed onto the stack, to avoid keeping an extra reference
	that may cause costly Tcl_Obj duplication. Detected by Franco Violi,
	analyzed by Peter Spjuth and Donal Fellows. [Bug 781585]

2003-07-28  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* doc/Translate.3: better documentation of Tcl_TranslateFileName and
	related functions. [Bug 775220]

2003-07-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Revert change made on 2003-07-21 since it made the
	sizeof(Tcl_Obj) different for regular vs mem debug builds.
	* generic/tclInt.h: Define TclDecrRefCount in terms of
	Tcl_DbDecrRefCount which removes one layer of inderection.
	* generic/tclObj.c (TclDbInitNewObj, Tcl_DbIncrRefCount,
	(Tcl_DbDecrRefCount, Tcl_DbIsShared): Define ThreadSpecificData that
	contains a hashtable. The table is used to ensure that a Tcl_Obj is
	only acted upon in the thread that allocated it. This checking code is
	enabled only when mem debug and threads are enabled.

2003-07-24  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/async.test:	Added several tests that demonstrate [Bug
	* tests/basic.test:	489537], Tcl's longstanding failure to
	* tests/dict.test:	properly quote any leading '#' character when
	* tests/dstring.test:	generating the string rep of a list so that
	* tests/list.test:	the comment-power of that character is hidden
	* tests/parse.test:	from any [eval], in order to satisfy the
	* tests/util.test:	documentation that [list] does [eval]-safe
				quoting.

2003-07-24  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* library/package.tcl: Fixed a typo that broke pkg_mkIndex -verbose.
	* tests/pkgMkIndex.test: Added a test for [pkg_mkIndex -verbose].

	* ChangeLog.2002 (new file):
	* ChangeLog: broke changes from 2002 into ChangeLog.2002 to reduce
	size of the main ChangeLog.

2003-07-23  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: changes to html-tcl & html-tk targets for
	compatibility with non-gnu makes.

	* unix/Makefile.in: added macosx/README to dist target.

2003-07-23  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinReg.c (OpenSubKey): Fixed bug 775976 which causes the
	registry set command to fail when built with VC7.
	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl: Incremented the version to 1.1.2.

2003-07-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Check that the thread incrementing or decrementing the ref count of a
	Tcl_Obj is the thread that originally allocated the thread. This fail
	fast behavior will catch programming errors that allow a single
	Tcl_Obj to be accessed from multiple threads.

	* generic/tcl.h (Tcl_Obj): Add allocThread member to Tcl_Obj. This
	member records the thread id the Tcl_Obj was allocated. It is used to
	check that any future ref count incr or decr is done from the same
	thread that allocated the Tcl_Obj. This member is defined only when
	threads and mem debug are enabled.
	* generic/tclInt.h (TclNewObj, TclDbNewObj, TclDecrRefCount):
	Define TclNewObj and TclDbNewObj using TclDbInitNewObj when mem debug
	is enabled. This fixes a problem where TclNewObj calls did not work
	the same as TclDbNewObj when mem debug was enabled.
	* generic/tclObj.c (TclDbInitNewObj, Tcl_DbIncrRefCount,
	(Tcl_DbDecrRefCount): Add new helper to init Tcl_Obj members when mem
	debug is enabled. Init the allocThread member in TclDbInitNewObj and
	check it in Tcl_DbIncrRefCount and Tcl_DbDecrRefCount to make sure a
	Tcl_Obj allocated in one thread is not being acted upon in another
	thread.

2003-07-21  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/cmdAH.test: ensure certain tests run in local filesystem. [Bug
	748960]

2003-07-18  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: added option to allow installing manpages in
	addition to default html help.

2003-07-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/Utf.3: Tightened up documentation of Tcl_UtfNext and Tcl_UtfPrev
	to better match the behaviour. [Bug 769895]

2003-07-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl: upped to http v2.4.4
	* library/http/http.tcl: add support for user:pass info in URL.
	* tests/http.test:       [Bug 759888] (shiobara)

2003-07-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:                Restored the [Eval] proc to replace
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:  the [::puts] command when either the
	-output or -error option for [test] is in use, in order to capture
	data written to the output or error channels for comparison against
	what is expected.  This is easier to document and agrees better with
	most user expectations than the previous attempt to replace [puts]
	only in the caller's namespace.  Documentation made more precise on
	the subject.  [Bug 706359]

	* doc/AddErrInfo.3:	Improved consistency of documentation by
	* doc/CrtTrace.3:      	using "null" everywhere to refer to the
	* doc/Encoding.3:      	character '\0', and using "NULL" everywhere
	* doc/Eval.3:          	to refer to the value of a pointer that points
	* doc/GetIndex.3:      	to nowhere. Also dropped references to ASCII
	* doc/Hash.3:          	that are no longer true, and standardized on
	* doc/LinkVar.3:       	the hyphenated spelling of "null-terminated".
	* doc/Macintosh.3:
	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3:
	* doc/SetVar.3:
	* doc/StringObj.3:
	* doc/Utf.3:

	* doc/CrtSlave.3 (Tcl_MakeSafe):  Removed warning about possible
	deprecation (no TIP on that).

2003-07-17  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: fix for compilation errors on platforms where
	configure detects non-functional chflags(). [Bug 748946]

	* macosx/Makefile: Rewrote buildsystem for Mac OS X framework build
	to be purely make driven; in order to become independent of Apple's
	closed-source IDE and build tool. The changes are intended to be
	transparent to the Makefile user, all existing make targets and cmd
	line variable overrides should continue to work. Changed build to only
	include tcl specific html help in Tcl.framework, the tk specific html
	help is now included in Tk.framework. Added var to allow overriding of
	tclsh used during html help building (Landon Fuller).

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj:
	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/jingham.pbxuser: Changed to purely call through to
	the make driven buildsystem; Tcl.framework is no longer assembled by
	ProjectBuilder.
	Set default SYMROOT in target options to simplify setting up PB
	(manually setting common build folder for tcl & tk no longer needed).

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: Added options to allow building only the
	tcl or tk html help files; the default behaviour with none of the new
	options is to build both, as before.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Added targets for building only the tcl or tk help

	* macosx/README (new): Tcl specific excerpts of tk/macosx/README.

	* generic/tcl.h: Updated reminder comment about editing
	macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj when version number changes.

2003-07-16  Mumit Khan  <khan@nanotech.wisc.edu>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c (SetFsPathFromAny): Add Cygwin specific code to
	convert POSIX filename to native format.
	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_TranslateFileName): And remove from here.
	(TclDoGlob): Adjust for cygwin and append / for dirs instead of \
	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpObjChdir): Use chdir on Cygwin.
	[Patch 679315]

2003-07-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/safe.tcl (FileInAccessPath): normalize paths before
	comparison. [Bug 759607] (myers)

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (NotifierThreadProc): correct size of found and
	word vars from int to long. [Bug 767578] (hgo)

	* generic/tcl.h:       Add recognition of -DTCL_UTF_MAX=6 on the make
	* generic/regcustom.h: line to support UCS-4 mode. No config arg at
	this time, as it is not the recommended build mode.

	* generic/tclPreserve.c: In Result and Preserve'd routines, do not
	* generic/tclUtil.c:     assume that ckfree == free, as that is not
	* generic/tclResult.c:   always true. [Bug 756791] (fuller)

2003-07-16  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/CrtSlave.3 (Tcl_MakeSafe): Updated documentation to strongly
	discourage use. IMHO code outside the core that uses this function is
	a bug... [Bug 655300]

2003-07-16  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_GlobObjCmd):	[Bug 771840]
	* generic/tclPathObj.c (Tcl_FSConvertToPathType):[Bug 771947]
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (GetModeFromPermString):	[Bug 771949]
	Silence compiler warnings about unreached lines.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl (ProcessFlags):	Corrected broken call
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:			to [lrange]. Bumped to
	version 2.2.4. [Bug 772333]

2003-07-15  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/dltest/pkga.c (Pkga_EqObjCmd): Fix typo that was causing a
	crash in load.test.

2003-07-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/array.n: Make sure docs are synched with the 8.4 release.

2003-07-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/http.n:  Updated SYNOPSIS to match actual syntax of commands.
	[Bug 756112]

	* unix/dltest/pkga.c:	Updated to not use Tcl_UtfNcmp and counted
	strings instead of strcmp (not defined in any #include'd header) and
	presumed NULL-terminated strings.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileIfCmd):  Prior fix of Bug 711371 on
	2003-04-07 introduced a buffer overflow. Corrected. [Bug 771613]

2003-07-15  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/rules.vc: Added a missing $(OPTDEFINES) which broke the build if
	STATS=memdbg was specified.

2003-07-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (SortCompare): Cleared up confusing error
	message. [Bug 771539]

2003-07-11  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/binary.test (binary-46.*): Tests to help enforce the current
	behaviour.
	* doc/binary.n: Documented that [binary format a] and [binary scan a]
	do encoding conversion by dropping high bytes, unlike the rest of the
	core. [Bug 735364]

2003-07-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl:  Corrected [pkg_mkIndex] bug reported on
	comp.lang.tcl. The indexer was searching for newly indexed packages
	instead of newly provided packages.

2003-07-08  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winFCmd.test: fix for five tests under win98 [Bug 767679]

2003-07-07  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/array.n: add examples from Welton

2003-06-23  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n: clarification of 'file tail' behaviour [Bug 737977]

2003-07-04  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/expr.n: Tighten up the wording of some operations. [Bug 758488]

	* tests/cmdAH.test: Made tests of [file mtime] work better on FAT
	filesystems. [Patch 760768]  Also a little general cleanup.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): Made [string map] accept
	dictionaries for maps.  This is much trickier than it looks, since map
	entry ordering is significant. [Bug 759936]

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_ArrayObjCmd, TclArraySet): Made [array get]
	and [array set] work with dictionaries, producing them and consuming
	them. Note that for compatibility reasons, you will never get a dict
	from feeding a string literal to [array set] since that alters the
	trace behaviour of "multi-key" sets. [Bug 759935]

2003-06-23  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTrace.c: fix to Window debug build compilation error.

2003-06-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/init.test: Added [cleanupTests] to report results of tests
	* tests/pkg.test:  that run in slave interps.  [Bugs 761334,761344]

	* tests/http.test: Used more reliable path to find httpd script.

2003-06-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/init.test:  Added tests init-4.6.* to illustrate [Bug 760872]

2003-06-25  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclTrace.c: New file, factoring out of virtually all the
	various trace-related things from tclBasic.c and tclCmdMZ.c with the
	goal of making this a separate maintenance area.

2003-06-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Add -ieee when compiling with cc and
	add -mieee when compiling with gcc under OSF1-V5 "Tru64" systems. [Bug
	748957]

2003-06-24  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/encoding.n: Corrected the docs to say that [source] uses the
	system encoding, which it always did anyway (since 8.1) [Bug 742100]

2003-06-24  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclHash.c (Tcl_HashStats): Prevented occurrence of
	division-by-zero problems.  [Bug 759749]

2003-06-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: #undef inet_ntoa before #define to avoid
	compiler warning under freebsd. [Bug 745844]

2003-06-23  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/dde.n:                 Committed TIP #135 which changes the
	* win/tclWinDde.c:           -exact option to -force. Also cleaned a
	* tests/winDde.test:         bug in the tests.
	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:  Incremented version to 1.2.5

	* doc/dde.n:                 Committed TIP #120 which provides the
	* win/tclWinDde.c:           dde package for safe interpreters.
	* tests/winDde.test:         Incremented package version to 1.2.4
	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:

2003-06-23  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFCmd.c: fix to bad error message when trying to do 'file
	copy foo ""'. [Bug 756951]
	* tests/fCmd.test: added two new tests for the bug.

	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: recommitted some filesystem globbing speed-ups,
	but disabled some on the older Win 95/98/ME where they don't seem to
	work.

	* doc/FileSystem.3: documentation fix [Bug 720634]

2003-06-18  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_Export): removed erroneous comments. [Bug
	756744]

2003-06-17  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc:  fixes to check-in below so compilation now works
	again on Windows.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* tests/regexp.test: fixing of bugs related to regexp and regsub
	matching of empty strings. Addition of a number of new tests. [Bug
	755335]

2003-06-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/Makefile.in:  Haven't heard back from David for a week. Now
	* win/configure:    committing the remaining changes.
	* win/configure.in: Note: In active contact with Helmut Giese about
	* win/makefile.vc:  the borland relatedchanges. This part will see
	* win/rules.vc:     future updates.
	* win/tcl.m4:
	* win/makefile.bc:

2003-06-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclConfig.c (ASSOC_KEY): Changed the key to
	"tclPackageAboutDict" (tcl prefix) to make collisions with the keys of
	other packages more unlikely.

2003-06-10  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: let TclExecuteObjvInternal call
	TclInterpReady instead of relying on its callers to do so; fix for the
	part of [Bug 495830] that is new in 8.4.
	* tests/interp.test: Added tests 18.9 (knownbug) and 18.10

2003-06-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tcl.decls:  Ported the changes from the
	* generic/tcl.h:      'tip-59-implementation' branch into the CVS
	* generic/tclBasic.c: head. Regenerated stub table. Regenerated the
	* generic/tclInt.h:   configure's scripts, with help from Joe English.
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclConfig.c:
	* generic/tclPkgConfig.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure.in:  The changes in the windows section are not yet
	* unix/tcl.m4:        committed, they await feedback from David
	* unix/mkLinks:       Gravereaux.
	* doc/RegConfig.3:
	* mac/tclMacPkgConfig.c:
	* tests/config.test:

2003-06-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* string.test (string-4.15): Added test for [string first] bug
	reported in Tcl 8.3, where test for all-single-byte-encoded strings
	was not reliable.

2003-06-04  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* tools/man2help.tcl: Added duplicate help section checking and
	* tools/index.tcl:    corrected a comment typo for the getTopics proc
	in index.tcl. [Bug 748700]

2003-06-02  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* tests/fCmd.test: fix to [Bug #747575] in which a bad error message
	is given when trying to rename a busy directory to one with the same
	prefix, but not the same name. Added three new tests.

2003-05-23  D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com>

	* win/tclWinTime.c: Add tests to detect and avoid a division by zero
	in the windows precision timer calibration logic.

2003-05-23  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c (tclCmdNameType):  Converted internal rep
	management of the cmdName Tcl_ObjType the opposite way, to always use
	the twoPtrValue instead of always using the otherValuePtr. Previous
	fix on 2003-05-12 broke several extensions that wanted to poke around
	with the twoPtrValue.ptr2 value of a cmdName Tcl_Obj, like TclBlend
	and e4graph. [Bug 726018]
	Thanks to George Petasis for the bug report and Jacob Levy for testing
	assistance.

2003-05-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/mkLinks: Set the var S to "" at the top of the file to avoid
	error when user has set S to something. [Tk Bug 739833]

2003-05-22  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: added missing references to new
	source files tclPathObj.c and tclMacOSXFCmd.c.

	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c: fixed a problem that caused only the first
	call to Tcl_MacOSXOpenVersionedBundleResources() for a given bundle
	identifier to succeed. This caused the tcl runtime library not to be
	found in all interps created after the inital one.

2003-05-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@hippolyta>

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: Corrected a bug in conversion of non-ASCII
	chars in the format string.

2003-05-19  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: changed tclConfig.sh location in
	versioned framework subdirectories to be identical to location in
	framework toplevel; fixed stub library symbolic links to be tcl
	version specific.

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: fixed typo.

2003-05-18  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* compat/strftime.c:  Modified TclpStrftime to return its result in
	* generic/tclClock.c: UTF-8 encoding, and removed the conversion from
	* mac/tclMacTime.c:   system encoding to UTF-8 from [clock format].
	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: Needed to avoid double conversion of the
	* win/tclWinTime.c:   timezone name on Windows systems. [Bug 624408]

2003-05-16  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:  Applied TIP #130 which provides for
	* tests/winDde.test:         unique dde server names. Added some more
	* win/tclWinDde.c:           tests. Fixes [Bug 219293]

	* doc/dde.n: Updated documentation re TIP #130.
	* tests/winDde.test: Applied patch for [Bug 738929] by KKB and changed
	to new-style tests.

2003-05-16  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/Makefile.in:	Removed one excess source file tclDToA.c

2003-05-16  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: updated copyright year.

2003-05-15  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclGetDate.y: added further hackery to the yacc
	* generic/tclDate.c:    post-processing to arrange for the code to set
	* unix/Makefile.in:     up exit handlers to free the stacks. [Bug
				736425]

2003-05-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpMatchInDirectory): revert glob code to r1.44
	as 2003-04-11 optimizations broke Windows98 glob'ing.

	* doc/socket.n: nroff font handling correction

	* library/encoding/gb2312-raw.enc (new): This is the original
	gb2312.enc renamed to allow for it to still be used. This is needed by
	Tk (unix) because X fonts with gb2312* charsets really do want the
	original gb2312 encoding. [Bug 557030]

2003-05-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd): Stop unwarranted demotion of
	wide values to longs by formatting of int values. [Bug 699060]

2003-05-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/encoding/gb2312.enc: copy euc-cn.enc over original
	gb2312.enc. gb2312.enc appeared to not work as expected, and most uses
	of gb2312 really mean euc-cn (which may be the cause of the problem).
	[Bug 557030]

2003-05-14  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	Implementation of TIP 118:

	* generic/tclFCmd.c (TclFileAttrsCmd): return the list of attributes
	that can be retrieved without error for a given file, instead of
	aborting the whole command when any error occurs.

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: added support for new file attributes and for
	copying Mac OS X file attributes & resource fork during [file copy].

	* generic/tclInt.decls: added declarations of new external commands
	needed by new file attributes support in tclUnixFCmd.c.

	* macosx/tclMacOSXFCmd.c (new): Mac OS X specific implementation of
	new file attributes and of attribute & resource fork copying.

	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c: added implementation of -rsrclength attribute &
	fixes to other attributes for consistency with OSX implementation.

	* mac/tclMacResource.c: fixes to OSType handling.

	* doc/file.n: documentation of [file attributes] changes.

	* unix/configure.in: check for APIs needed by new file attributes.

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added new platform specifc tclMacOSXFCmd.c source.

	* unix/configure:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: regen.

	* tools/genStubs.tcl: fixes to completely broken code trying to
	prevent overlap of "aqua", "macosx", "x11" and "unix" stub entries.

	* tests/unixFCmd.test: added tests of -readonly attribute.

	* tests/macOSXFCmd.test (new): tests of macosx file attributes and of
	preservation of attributes & resource fork during [file copy].

	* tests/macFCmd.test: restore -readonly attribute of test dir, as
	otherwise its removal can fail on unices supporting -readonly.

2003-05-13  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclEnv.c: Another putenv() copy behavior problem repaired
	when compiling on windows and using microsoft's runtime. [Bug 736421]

2003-05-13  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: ensure cd is thread-safe.
	[Bug 710642] (vasiljevic)

2003-05-13  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): Removed unused variable to reduce
	compiler warnings. [Bug 664745]

2003-05-13  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* generic/tcl.decls:  Changed Tcl_JoinThread parameter name from
	* generic/tclDecls.h: "id" to "threadId". [Bug 732477]
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c:
	* mac/tclMacThrd.c:

2003-05-13  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c: added extended version of the
	Tcl_MacOSXOpenBundleResources() API taking an extra version number
	argument: Tcl_MacOSXOpenVersionedBundleResources(). This is needed to
	be able to access bundle resources in versioned frameworks such as Tcl
	and Tk, otherwise if multiple versions were installed, only the latest
	version's resources could be accessed. [Bug 736774]

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (Tcl_MacOSXGetLibraryPath): use new versioned
	bundle resource API to get tcl runtime library for TCL_VERSION. [Bug
	736774]

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: regen.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: worked around the issue of realpath() not
	being thread-safe on Mac OS X by defining NO_REALPATH for threaded
	builds on Mac OS X. [Bug 711232]

2003-05-12  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: General clean-up of tests so that all
	tcltest-specific commands are protected by constraints and all
	platforms see the same number of tests. [Bug 736431]

2003-05-12  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInterp.c: (AliasObjCmd):   Added refCounting of the words
	* tests/interp.test (interp-33.1):      of the target of an interp
	alias during its execution. Also added test. [Bug 730244]

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclInvokeObjectCommand):  objv[argc] is no
	longer set to NULL (Tcl_CreateObjCommand docs already say that it
	should not be accessed).

	* tests/cmdMZ.test:  Forgot to import [temporaryDirectory].

	* generic/tclObj.c (tclCmdNameType):  Corrected variable use of the
	otherValuePtr or the twoPtrValue.ptr1 fields to store a
	(ResolvedCmdName *) as the internal rep. [Bug 726018]

	* doc/Eval.3:  Corrected prototype for Tcl_GlobalEvalObj [Bug 727622].

2003-05-12  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclObjLookupVar): [Bug 735335] temporary fix,
	disabling usage of tclNsVarNameType.
	* tests/var.test (var-15.1): test for [Bug 735335]

2003-05-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialCloseProc): correct mem leak on closing a
	Windows serial port [Bug 718002] (schroedter)

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): prevent string repeat crash
	when overflow sizes were given (throws error). [Bug 714106]

2003-05-09  Joe Mistachkin <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (TclFreeAllocCache): Fixed memory leak
	caused by treating cachePtr as a TLS index. [Bug 731754]

	* win/tclAppInit.c (Tcl_AppInit): Fixed memory leaks caused by not
	freeing the memory allocated by setargv and the async handler created
	by Tcl_AppInit. An exit handler has been created that takes care of
	both leaks. In addition, Tcl_AppInit now uses ckalloc instead of
	Tcl_Alloc to allow for easier leak tracking and to be more consistent
	with the rest of the Tcl core. [Bugs 733156, 733221]

	* tools/encoding/txt2enc.c (main): Fixed memory leak caused by failing
	to free the memory used by the toUnicode array of strings [Bug 733221]

2003-05-09  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript):
	* tests/compile.test (compile-3.5): corrected wrong test and
	behaviour in the earlier fix for [Bug 705406]; Don Porter reported
	this as [Bug 735055], and provided the solution.

2003-05-09  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_ReturnObjCmd): The array of strings passed
	to Tcl_GetIndexFromObj must be NULL terminated. [Bug 735186]
	Thanks to Joe Mistachkin for spotting this.

2003-05-07  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/trace.n: Fixed very strange language in the documentation for
	'trace add execution'. [Bug 729821]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TraceObjCmd): Made error message for 'trace
	info' more consistent with documentation. [Bug 706961]

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictInfoCmd): Fixed memory leak caused by
	confusion about string ownership.  [Bug 731706]

2003-05-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:		Implementation of TIP 90, which
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:		extends the [catch] and [return]
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:	commands to enable creation of a
	* generic/tclExecute.c:		proc that is a replacement for
	* generic/tclInt.h:		[return]. [Patch 531640]
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclResult.c:
	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:
	* tests/error.test:
	* tests/proc-old.test:

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: The -returnCodes option to [test]
	failed to recognize the symbolic name "ok" for return code 0.

2003-05-05  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_HideCommand): Fixed error message for
	grammar and spelling.

2003-04-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictIncrCmd): Updated to reflect the behaviour
	with wide increments of the normal [incr] command.
	* generic/tclInt.decls: Added TclIncrWideVar2 to internal stub table
	and cleaned up.
	* tests/incr.test (incr-3.*):
	* generic/tclVar.c (TclIncrWideVar2, TclPtrIncrWideVar):
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode):
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_IncrObjCmd): Make [incr] work when trying to
	increment by wide values. [Bug 728838]

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSwitchCmd): Default mode of
	operation of [switch] is exact matching. [Bug 727563]

2003-04-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:  Tcl_EvalObjv() failed to honor the
	TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL flag when resolving command names. Tcl_EvalEx passed a
	string rep including leading whitespace and comments to
	TclEvalObjvInternal().

2003-04-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c: Applied SF patch #727271. This patch changes the
	code to catch any errors returned by the windows functions handling
	TLS ASAP instead of waiting to get some mysterious crash later on due
	to bogus pointers. Patch provided by Joe Mistachkin.

	This is a stop-gap measure to deal with the low number of ?TLS slots
	provided by some of the variants of Windows (60-80).

2003-04-24  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: fix to bug reported privately by Jeff where,
	for example, 'glob -path {[tcl]} *' gets confused by the leading
	special character (which is escaped internally), and instead lists
	files in '/'. Bug only occurs on Windows where '\' is also a directory
	separator.
	* tests/fileName.test: added test for the above bug.

2003-04-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* The changes below fix SF bugs [593810], and [718045].

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_CutChannel, Tcl_SpliceChannel): Invoke
	TclpCutSockChannel and TclpSpliceSockChannel.

	* generic/tclInt.h: Declare TclpCutSockChannel and
	TclpSpliceSockChannel.

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c (TclpCutSockChannel, TclpSpliceSockChannel):
	Dummy functions, on unix the sockets are _not_ handled specially.

	* mac/tclMacSock.c (TclpCutSockChannel, TclpSpliceSockChannel):
	* win/tclWinSock.c (TclpCutSockChannel, TclpSpliceSockChannel): New
	functions to handle socket specific cut/splice operations: auto-init
	of socket system for thread on splice, management of the module
	internal per-thread list of sockets, management of association of
	sockets with HWNDs for event notification.

	* win/tclWinSock.c (NewSocketInfo): Extended initialization
	assignments to cover all items of the structure. During debugging of
	the new code mentioned above I found that two fileds could contain
	bogus data.

	* win/tclWinFile.c: Added #undef HAVE_NO_FINDEX_ENUMS before
	definition because when compiling in debug mode the compiler complains
	about a redefinition, and this warning is also treated as an error.

2003-04-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:  When the return code of a test does
	not meet expectations, report that as the reason for test failure, and
	do not attempt to check the test result for correctness. [Bug 725253]

2003-04-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinInt.h (VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_CE): conditionally define.
	* win/tclWinInit.c: recognize Windows CE as a Win platform. This just
	recognizes CE - full support will come later.

	* win/configure: regen
	* win/configure.in (SHELL): force it to /bin/sh as autoconf 2.5x
	uses /bin/bash, which can fail to find exes in the path (ie: lib).

	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExprCallMathFunc): remove incorrect
	extraneous cast from Tcl_WideAsDouble.

2003-04-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/open.n:		Moved serial port options from [fconfigure] to
	* doc/fconfigure.n:	[open] as it is up to the creator of a channel
				to describe the channel's special config
				options. [Bug 679010]

2003-04-16  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:	Made changes so that the "wideInt" Tcl_ObjType
	* generic/tclObj.c:	is defined on all platforms, even those where
	* generic/tclPort.h:	TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG is defined. Also made the
	Tcl_Value struct have a wideValue field on all platforms. This is a
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** for TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG platforms
	because that struct changes size. This is the same TIP 72
	incompatibility that was seen on other platforms at the 8.4.0 release,
	when this change should have happened as well. [Bug 713562]

	* generic/tclInt.h:  New internal macros TclGetWide() and
	TclGetLongFromWide() to deal with both forms of the "wideInt"
	Tcl_ObjType, so that conditional TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG code is confined
	to the header file.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:	Replaced most coding that was conditional
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:	on TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG with code that
	* generic/tclExecute.c: works across platforms, sometimes using
	* generic/tclTest.c:	the new macros above to do it.
	* generic/tclUtil.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c:

2003-04-17  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/socket.n: Added a paragraph to remind people to specify their
	encodings when using sockets. [Bug 630621]

2003-04-16  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/CrtMathFnc.3: Functions also have to deal with wide ints, but
	this was not documented. [Bug 709720]

2003-04-16  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: removed undesired 'static' for function which
	is now shared (previously it was duplicated).

2003-04-15  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/namespace.n: added example section "SCOPED SCRIPTS", supplied by
	Kevin Kenny. [Bug 219183]

2003-04-15  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* makefile.vc: Updated makefile.vc to conform with Mo DeJong's changes
	to Makefile.in and tclWinPipe.c on 2003-04-14. Now passes TCL_PIPE_DLL
	in place of TCL_DBGX.
	* win/tclWinTime.c: Corrected use of types to make compilation
	compatible with VC++5.

2003-04-15  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: finished check-in from yesterday, removing
	duplicate function definition.

2003-04-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclClock.c:	Corrected compiler warnings.
	* generic/tclTest.c:

2003-04-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/Makefile.in: Don't define TCL_DBGX symbol for every compile.
	Instead, define TCL_PIPE_DLL only when compiling tclWinPipe.c. This
	will break other build systems, so they will need to remove the
	TCL_DBGX define and replace it with a define for TCL_PIPE_DLL.
	* win/tclWinPipe.c (TclpCreateProcess): Remove PREFIX_IDENT and
	DEBUG_IDENT from top of file. Use TCL_PIPE_DLL passed in from build
	env instead of trying to construct the dll name from already defined
	symbols. This approach is more flexible and better in the long run.

2003-04-14  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: added conditionals to restore compilation on
	VC++6, which was broken by recent changes.

2003-04-14  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclPathObj.c:
	* generic/tclFileSystem.h: overlooked one function which was
	duplicated, so this is now shared between modules.
	* win/tclWinFile.c: allow this file to compile with VC++ 5.2 again
	since Mingw build fixes broke that.

2003-04-13  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Add check for FINDEX_INFO_LEVELS from winbase.h,
	known to be a problem in VC++ 5.2. Define HAVE_NO_FINDEX_ENUMS if the
	define does not exist.
	* win/tclWinFile.c: Put declarations for FINDEX_INFO_LEVELS and
	FINDEX_SEARCH_OPS inside a check for HAVE_NO_FINDEX_ENUMS so that
	these are not declared twice. This fixes the Mingw build.
	* win/tclWinTime.c: Rework the init of timeInfo so that the number or
	initializers matches the declaration. This was broken under Mingw. Add
	cast to avoid compile warning when calling the AccumulateSample
	function.

2003-04-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/Makefile.in (GENERIC_OBJS): add missing tclPathObj.c

2003-04-12  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/clock.n:
	* generic/tclClock.c (Tcl_ClockObjCmd):
	* tests/clock.test: Implementation of TIP #124. Also renumbered test
	cases to avoid duplicates. [Bug 710310]
	* tests/winTime.test:
	* win/tclWinTest.c (TestwinclockCmd, TestwinsleepCmd):
	* win/tclWinTime.c (Tcl_WinTime, UpdateTimeEachSecond,
	(ResetCounterSamples, AccumulateSample, SAMPLES, TimeInfo): Made
	substantial changes to the phase-locked loop (replaced an IIR filter
	with an FIR one) in a quest for improved loop stability (Bug not
	logged at SF, but cited in private communication from Jeff Hobbs).

2003-04-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd,STR_IS_INT):  Corrected
	inconsistent results of [string is integer] observed on systems where
	sizeof(long) != sizeof(int). [Bug 718878]
	* tests/string.test: Added tests for Bug 718878.
	* doc/string.n: Clarified that [string is integer] accepts 32-bit
	integers.

2003-04-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (UpdateInterest): When dropping interest in
	TCL_READABLE now dropping interest in TCL_EXCEPTION too. This fixes a
	bug where Expect detects eof on a file prematurely on solaris 2.6 and
	higher. A much more complete explanation is in the code itself (40
	lines of comments for a one-line change :)

2003-04-11  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: fix test suite problem if /home is a symlink. [Bug
	703264]
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix bad error message with 'cd ""'. [Bug
	704917]
	* win/tclWinFile.c, win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* win/tclWinInt.h: allow Tcl to differentiate between reparse points
	which are symlinks and mounted volumes, and correctly handle the
	latter. This involves some elaborate code to find the actual drive
	letter (if possible) corresponding to a mounted volume. [Bug 697862]
	* tests/fileSystem.test: add constraints to stop tests running in
	ordinary tcl interpreter. [Bug 705675]

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclPathObj.c: (new file)
	* generic/tclFileSystem.h: (new file)
	* win/makefile.vc:
	Split path object handling out of the virtual filesystem layer, into
	tclPathObj.c. This refactoring cleans up the internal filesystem code,
	and will make any future optimisations and forthcoming better
	thread-safety much easier.

	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* tests/reg.test: added some 'knownBug' tests for problems in Tcl's
	regexp code with the TCL_REG_CAN_MATCH flag (see Bug 703709). Code too
	impenetrable to fix right now, but a fix is needed for tip113 to work
	correctly.

	* tests/fCmd.test
	* win/tclWinFile.c: added some filesystem optimisation to the 'glob'
	implementation, and some new tests.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: fix typo in comment

	* tests/winFile.test:
	* tests/ioUtil.test:
	* tests/unixFCmd.test: renumbered tests with duplicate numbers. [Bug
	710361]

2003-04-10  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/binary.n: Fixed typo in [binary format w] desc. [Bug 718543]

2003-04-08  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_ErrorObjCmd): Strings are only empty if
	they have zero length, not if their first byte is zero, so fix test
	guarding Tcl_AddObjErrorInfo to take this into account. [Bug
	reported by Don Porter; no bug-id.]

2003-04-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileIfCmd):  Corrected string limits of
	arguments interpolated in error messages. [Bug 711371]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceExecutionProc):  Added missing
	Tcl_DiscardResult() call to avoid memory leak.

2003-04-07  Donal K. Fellows  <zzcgudf@ernie.mvc.mcc.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (Tcl_DictObjCmd): Stopped compilers from
	moaning about switch fall-through.  [Bug 716327]
	(DictFilterCmd): Yet more warning killing, this time reported by
	Miguel Sofer by private chat.

2003-04-07  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/dict.test (dict-2.6):
	* generic/tclDictObj.c (Tcl_NewDictObj, Tcl_DbNewDictObj): Oops!
	Failed to fully initialise the Dict structure.
	(DictIncrCmd): Moved valueAlreadyInDictionary label to stop compiler
	complaints. [Bug 715751]

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictIncrCmd): Followed style in the rest of
	the core by commenting out wide-specific operations on platforms where
	wides are longs, and used longs more thoroughly than ints through
	[dict incr] anyway to forestall further bugs.
	* generic/tclObj.c: Made sure there's always a tclWideIntType
	implementation available, not that it is always useful. [Bug 713562]

2003-04-05  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c: Removed commented out notes on declarations to
	be moved to elsewhere in the Tcl core.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Final stages of plumbing in.
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclObj.c (TclInitObjSubsystem):

	* unix/Makefile.in, win/Makefile.in, win/makefile.[bv]c: Build support.
	* generic/tcl.decls: Added dict public API to stubs table.
	* generic/tcl.h (Tcl_DictSearch): Added declaration of structure to
	allow user code to iterate over dictionaries.

	* doc/DictObj.3:	New files containing dictionary implementation
	* doc/dict.n:		documentation and tests as as mandated by TIP
	* generic/tclDictObj.c: #111.
	* tests/dict.test:

2003-04-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Don't set TCL_LIBS if it is already
	set to support use of TCL_LIBS var from tclConfig.sh in the Tk
	configure script.

2003-04-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Don't subst MATH_LIBS, LIBS, and DL_LIBS
	separately. Instead, just subst TCL_LIBS since it includes the
	others.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS, SC_TCL_LINK_LIBS): Set and subst
	TCL_LIBS in SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS instead of SC_TCL_LINK_LIBS. Don't subst
	MATH_LIBS since it is now covered by TCL_LIBS.
	* unix/tclConfig.sh.in: Use TCL_LIBS instead of DL_LIBS, LIBS, and
	MATH_LIBS.
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: Ditto.

2003-04-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileReturnCmd):  Now that [return]
	compiles to INST_RETURN, it is safe to compile even outside a proc.

2003-04-02  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Set stub lib flag based on new LIBFLAGSUFFIX
	variable.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Set new LIBFLAGSUFFIX that works like
	LIBSUFFIX, it is used when creating library names. The previous
	implementation would generate -ltclstub85 instead of -ltclstub85s when
	configured with --disable-shared.

2003-04-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c (TclSubstTokens):  Moved declaration of
	utfCharBytes to beginning of procedure so that it does not go out of
	scope (get free()d) while append is still pointing to it. [Bugs
	703167, 713754]

2003-04-01  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Check for inet_ntoa in -lbind inside
	the BeOS block since doing it later broke the build under SuSE 7.3.
	[Bug 713128]

2003-04-01  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/README:  Direct [source] of *.test files is no longer
	recommended. The tests/*.test files should only be evaluated under the
	control of the [runAllTests] command in tests/all.tcl.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_RETURN):  Bytecompiled [return] failed to
	reset iPtr->returnCode, causing tests parse-18.17 and parse-18.21 to
	fail strangely.
	* tests/parse.test (parse-18.21):  Corrected now functioning test.
	Added further coverage tests.

2003-03-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/parse.test (parse-18.*):  Coverage tests for the new
	implementation of Tcl_SubstObj(). Note that tests parse-18.17 and
	parse-18.21 demonstrate some bugs left to fix in the current code.

2003-03-27  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Use -Wl,--export-dynamic instead of
	-rdynamic for LDFLAGS. The -rdynamic is not documented so it seems
	better to pass the --export-dynamic flag to the linker. [Patch 573395]

2003-03-27  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/encoding.test:
	* tests/proc-old.test:
	* tests/set-old.test: Altered test numers to eliminate duplicates,
	[Bugs 710313, 710320, 710352]

2003-03-27  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

2003-03-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS, SC_TCL_LINK_LIBS): Add BeOS system to
	SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS. Check for inet_ntoa in -lbind, needed for BeOS.

2003-03-26  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:  Added reporting during [configure
	-debug 1] operations to warn about multiple uses of the same test
	name. [FRQ 576693]

	* tests/msgcat.test (msgcat-2.2.1): changed test name to avoid
	duplication. [Bug 710356]

	* unix/dltest/pkg?.c:  Changed all Tcl_InitStubs calls to pass
	argument exact = 0, so that rebuilds are not required when Tcl
	bumps to a new version.  [Bug 701926]

2003-03-24  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c:
	* tests/var.test: fixing ObjMakeUpvar's lookup algorithm for the
	created local variable. [Bug 631741] (Chris Darroch) and [Bug 696893]
	(David Hilker)

2003-03-24  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl: bumped version to 1.2.2 in tclWinDde.c,
	now adding here too.

2003-03-22  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl: Fixed a bug where [package require dde]
	or [package require registry] attempted to load the release version
	of the DLL into a debug build. [Bug 708218] Thanks to Joe Mistachkin
	for the patch.
	* win/makefile.vc: Added quoting around the script name in the 'test'
	target; Joe Mistachkin insists that he has a configuration that fails
	to launch tcltest without it, and it appears harmless otherwise.

2003-03-22  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c: Make dde services conform the the documentation
	such that giving only a topic name really returns all services with
	that topic. [Bug 219155]
	Prevent hangup caused by dde server applications failing to process
	messages. [Bug 707822]
	* tests/winDde.test: Corrected labels and added a test for search by
	topic name.

2003-03-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h (tclOriginalNotifier):
	* generic/tclStubInit.c (tclOriginalNotifier):
	* mac/tclMacNotify.c (Tcl_SetTimer,Tcl_WaitForEvent):
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_SetTimer,Tcl_WaitForEvent,
	(Tcl_CreateFileHandler,Tcl_DeleteFileHandler):
	* win/tclWinNotify.c (Tcl_SetTimer,Tcl_WaitForEvent):  Some linkers
	apparently use a different representation for a pointer to a function
	within the same compilation unit and a pointer to a function in a
	different compilation unit. This causes checks like those in the
	original notifier procedures to fall into infinite loops. The fix is
	to store pointers to the original notifier procedures in a struct
	defined in the same compilation unit as the stubs tables, and compare
	against those values. [Bug 707174]

	* generic/tclInt.h:  Removed definition of ParseValue struct that is
	no longer used.

2003-03-19  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* tests/compile.test: bad command count on TCL_OUT_LINE_COMPILE.
	[Bug 705406] (Don Porter)

2003-03-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/auto.tcl:		Replaced [regexp] and [regsub] with
	* library/history.tcl:		[string map] where possible.  Thanks
	* library/ldAout.tcl:		to David Welton. [Bugs 667456,667558]
	* library/safe.tcl:		Bumped to http 2.4.3, opt 0.4.5, and
	* library/http/http.tcl:	tcltest 2.2.3.
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/opt/optparse.tcl:
	* library/opt/pkgIndex.tcl:

	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* tools/genStubs.tcl:
	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl:
	* unix/mkLinks.tcl:

	* doc/Eval.3 (Tcl_EvalObjEx):			Corrected CONST and
	* doc/ParseCmd.3 (Tcl_EvalTokensStandard):	return type errors in
	documentation. [Bug 683994]

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileReturnCmd):  Alternative fix for
	* generic/tclCompile.c (INST_RETURN):	[Bug 633204] that uses a new
	* generic/tclCompile.h (INST_RETURN):	bytecode INST_RETURN to
	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_RETURN):	properly bytecode the [return]
	command to something that returns TCL_RETURN.

2003-03-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Don't run the AC_CYGWIN macro since it uses
	AC_CANONICAL_HOST under autoconf 2.5X. Just check to see if __CYGWIN__
	is defined by the compiler and set the ac_cv_cygwin variable based on
	that. [Bug 705912]

2003-03-18  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/registry.test: Changed the conditionals to avoid an abort if
	[testlocale] is missing, as when running the test in tclsh rather than
	tcltest. [Bug 705677]

2003-03-18  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: added support for building 'make html'
	from inside distribution directories named with 8.x.x version numbers.
	tcltk-man2html now uses the latest tcl8.x.x resp. tk8.x.x directories
	found inside its --srcdir argument.

2003-03-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/format.test: Renumber tests, a bunch of tests all had the same
	id.

2003-03-17  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lsearch.n:	Altered documentation of -ascii options so
	* doc/lsort.n:		they don't specify that they operate on ASCII
				strings, which they never did anyway. [Bug
				703807]

2003-03-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd): Only add the modifier that
	indicates we've got a wide int when we're formatting in an integer
	style.  Stops some libc's from going mad. [Bug 702622] Also tidied
	whitespace.

2003-03-13  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_WITH_TCL): Port version number fix that was made in
	tk instead of tcl sources.

2003-03-13  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Require autoconf 2.57 or newer, see TIP 34 for a detailed explanation
	of why this is good. This will no doubt break the build on some
	platforms, let the flaming begin.

	* tools/configure: Regen with autoconf 2.57.
	* tools/configure.in: Require autoconf 2.57.
	* unix/configure: Regen with autoconf 2.57.
	* unix/configure.in: Require autoconf 2.57.
	Apply AC_LIBOBJ changes from patch 529884.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Ditto.
	* win/configure: Regen with autoconf 2.57.
	* win/configure.in: Require autoconf 2.57.
	Don't subst LIBOBJS since this happens by default, this avoids an
	autoconf error.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalTokensStandard):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObj):
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSwitchCmd):
	* generic/tclCompExpr.c (CompileSubExpr):
	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclSetByteCodeFromAny,TclCompileScript,
	(TclCompileTokens,TclCompileCmdWord):
	* generic/tclCompile.h (TclCompileScript):

	* generic/tclInt.h (Interp,TCL_BRACKET_TERM,TclSubstTokens):
	* generic/tclParse.c (ParseTokens,Tcl_SubstObj,TclSubstTokens):
	* tests/subst.test (2.4, 8.7, 8.8, 11.4, 11.5):
	Substantial refactoring of Tcl_SubstObj to make use of the same
	parsing and substitution procedures as normal script evaluation.
	Tcl_SubstObj() moved to tclParse.c. New routine TclSubstTokens()
	created in tclParse.c which implements all substantial functioning of
	Tcl_EvalTokensStandard(). TclCompileScript() loses its "nested"
	argument, the Tcl_Interp struct loses its termOffset field and the
	TCL_BRACKET_TERM flag in the evalFlags field, all of which were only
	used (indirectly) by Tcl_SubstObj(). Tests subst-8.7,8.8,11.4,11.5
	modified to accomodate the only behavior change: reporting of parse
	errors now takes precedence over [return] and [continue] exceptions.
	All other behavior should remain compatible. [RFE 536831,684982] [Bug
	685106]

	* generic/tcl.h:        Removed TCL_PREFIX_IDENT and TCL_DEBUG_IDENT
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:     from tcl.h -- they are not part of Tcl's
	public interface.  Put them in win/tclWinPipe.c where they are used.

	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_InterpObjCmd):       Corrected and added
	* tests/interp.test (interp-2.13):              test for option
	parsing beyond objc for [interp create --]. Thanks to Marco Maggi.
	[Bug 702383]

2003-03-11  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc: Added two missing uses of $(DBGX) so that
	tclpip8x.dll loads without panicking on Win9x.

2003-03-09  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestChannelCmd): Removed an unused local variable
	that caused compilation problems on some platforms.

2003-03-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:  Added missing "-body" to example. Thanks to Helmut
	Giese. [Bug 700011]

2003-03-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test:
	* tests/ioCmd.test: Define a fcopy constraint and add it to the
	constraint list of any test that depends on the fcopy command. This is
	only useful to Jacl which does not support fcopy.

2003-03-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/encoding.test: Name temp files *.tcltestout instead of *.out
	so that when they are removed later, we don't accidently toast any
	files named *.out that the user has created in the build directory.

2003-03-07  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FileObjCmd): Fix the setting of a file's
	mtime and atime on 64-bit platforms. [Bug 698146]

2003-03-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test: Doh! Undo accidental commenting out of a couple of
	tests.

2003-03-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test: Define a fileevent constraint and add it to the
	constraint list of any test that depends on the fileevent command.
	This is only useful to Jacl which does not support fileevent.

2003-03-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test: Define an openpipe constraint and add it to the
	constraint list of any test that creates a pipe using the open
	command. This is only useful to Jacl which does not support pipes.

2003-03-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/TclUtf.c (Tcl_UniCharNcasecmp):       Corrected failure to
	* tests/utf.test (utf-25.*):    properly compare Unicode strings of
	different case in a case insensitive manner.  [Bug 699042]

2003-03-06  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSwitchCmd):
	Replaced a non-portable 'bzero' with a portable 'memset'. [Bug 698442]

2003-03-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Seek, Tcl_OutputBuffered): If there is data
	buffered in the statePtr->curOutPtr member then set the BUFFER_READY
	flag in Tcl_Seek. This is needed so that the next call to FlushChannel
	will write any buffered bytes before doing the seek. The existing code
	would set the BUFFER_READY flag inside the Tcl_OutputBuffered
	function. This was a programming error made when Tcl_OutputBuffered
	was originally created in CVS revision 1.35. The setting of the
	BUFFER_READY flag should not have been included in the
	Tcl_OutputBuffered function.
	* generic/tclTest.c (TestChannelCmd): Use the Tcl_InputBuffered and
	Tcl_OutputBuffered util methods to query the amount of buffered input
	and output.

2003-03-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Flush): Compare the nextAdded member of the
	ChannelBuffer to the nextRemoved member to determine if any output has
	been buffered. The previous check against the value 0 seems to have
	just been a coding error. See other methods like Tcl_OutputBuffered
	for examples where nextAdded is compared to nextRemoved to find the
	number of bytes buffered.

2003-03-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_GetsObj): Check that the eol pointer has not
	gone past the end of the string when in auto translation mode and the
	INPUT_SAW_CR flag is set. The previous code worked because the end of
	string value \0 was being compared to \n, this patch just skips that
	pointless check.

2003-03-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (WriteBytes, WriteChars, Tcl_GetsObj, ReadBytes):
	Rework calls to TranslateOutputEOL to make it clear that a boolean
	value is being returned. Add some comments in an effort to make the
	code more clear. This patch makes no functional changes.

2003-03-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_SetChannelOption): Invoke the
	Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize method as a result of changing the
	-buffersize option to fconfigure. The previous implementation used
	some inlined code that reset the buffer size to the default size
	instead of ignoring the request as implemented in
	Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize.
	* tests/io.test: Update test case so that it actually checks the
	implementation of Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize.

2003-03-05  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/rules.vc: updated default tcl version to 8.5.

2003-03-05  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSwitchCmd): First attempt at a
	bytecode-compiled switch command. It only handles the most common case
	of switching, but that should be enough for this to speed up a lot of
	people's code. It is expected that the speed gains come from two
	things: better handling of the switch itself, and integrated
	compilation of the arms instead of embedding separate bytecode
	sequences (i.e. better local variable handling.)
	* tests/switch.test (switch-10.*): Tests of both uncompiled and
	compiled switch behaviour. [Patch #644819]

	* generic/tclCompile.h (TclFixupForwardJumpToHere): Additional macro
	to make the most common kind of jump fixup a bit easier.

2003-03-04  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	*** 8.4.2 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

2003-03-03  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	Mac OS Classic specific fixes:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (TclNewFSPathObj): on TCL_PLATFORM_MAC, skip
	potential directory separator at the beginning of addStrRep.
	* mac/tclMacChan.c (OpenFileChannel, CommonWatch): followup fixes to
	cut and splice implementation for file channels.
	* mac/tclMacFile.c (TclpUtime): pass native path to utime().
	* mac/tclMacFile.c (TclpObjLink): correctly implemented creation of
	alias files via new static proc CreateAliasFile().
	* mac/tclMacPort.h: define S_ISLNK macro to fix stat'ing of links.
	* mac/tclMacUtil.c (FSpLocationFromPathAlias): fix to enable stat'ing
	of broken links.

2003-03-03  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/Makefile.vc: corrected bug introduced by 'g' for debug builds.

2003-03-03  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:	dde bumped to version 1.2.1 for
	* win/tclWinDde.c:		bundled release with Tcl 8.4.2

	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl:	registry bumped to version 1.1.1 for
	* win/tclWinReg.c:		bundled release with Tcl 8.4.2

	* library/opt/pkgIndex.tcl:	updated package index to version 0.4.4

2003-02-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: check for 'g' for debug build type, not 'd'.
	* win/rules.vc (DBGX): correct to use 'g' for nmake win makefile to
	match the cygwin makefile for debug builds. [Bug 635107]

2003-02-28  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n: subcommand is 'file volumes' not 'file volume'

2003-02-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (MakeFsPathFromRelative): removed dead code
	check of typePtr (darley).

	* tests/winTime.test: added note about PCI hardware dependency issues
	with high performance clock.

2003-02-27  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/lsearch.test (lsearch-10.7):
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsearchObjCmd): Stopped -start option from
	causing an option when used with an empty list. [Bug 694232]

2003-02-26  Chengye Mao <chengye.geo@yahoo.com>

	* win/tclWinInit.c: fixed a bug in TclpSetVariables by initializing
	dwUserNameLen with the sizeof(szUserName) before calling GetUserName.
	Don't know if this bug has been recorded: it caused crash in starting
	Tcl or wish in Windows.

2003-02-26  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceCommandProc): Fix mem leak when deleting a
	command that had trace on it. [Bug 693564] (sofer)

2003-02-25  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/pkgMkIndex.n:	Modified [pkg_mkIndex] to use -nocase matching
	* library/package.tcl:	of -load patterns, to better accomodate common
	user errors due to confusion between [package names] names and [info
	loaded] names.

2003-02-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* tests/pid.test: See below [Bug 678412].
	* tests/io.test: Made more robust against spaces in paths [Bug 678400]

2003-02-25  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/execute.test: cleaning up testobj's at the end, to avoid
	  leak warning by valgrind.

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_FinalizeThread): Fix [Bug 571002]

2003-02-21  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/binary.test (binary-44.[34]):
	* generic/tclBinary.c (ScanNumber): Fixed problem with unwanted
	sign-bit propagation when scanning wide ints. [Bug 690774]

2003-02-21  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacChan.c (TclpCutFileChannel, TclpSpliceFileChannel):
	Implemented missing cut and splice procs for file channels.

2003-02-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl (tclPkgUnknown):  Minor performance tweaks to
	reduce the number of [file] invocations. Meant to improve startup
	times, at least a little bit. [Patch 687906]

2003-02-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c: (macosx) use vfork() instead of fork() to create
	new processes, as recommended by Apple (vfork can be up to 100 times
	faster thank fork on macosx).
	* unix/configure: regen.

2003-02-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (LoadTableEncoding):
	* library/encoding/cp932.enc:      Correct jis round-trip encoding
	* library/encoding/euc-jp.enc:     by adding 'R' type to .enc files.
	* library/encoding/iso2022-jp.enc: [Patch 689341] (koboyasi, taguchi)
	* library/encoding/jis0208.enc:
	* library/encoding/shiftjis.enc:
	* tests/encoding.test:

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (Tcl_MakeTcpClientChannel): add
	MakeTcpClientChannelMode that takes actual mode flags to avoid hang on
	OS X (may be OS X bug, but patch works x-plat). [Bug 689835] (steffen)

2003-02-20  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/regsub.n: Typo fix [Bug 688943]

2003-02-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpReaddir):
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: update to Bug 689100 patch to ensure that there
	is a defined value of MAXNAMLEN (aka NAME_MAX in POSIX) and that we
	have some buffer allocated.

2003-02-19  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c: restored Tcl_SetObjLength() side-effect of
	always invalidating unicode rep (if the obj has a string rep). Added
	hasUnicode flag to String struct, allows decoupling of validity of
	unicode rep from buffer size allocated to it (improves memory
	allocation efficiency). [Bugs 686782, 671138, 635200]

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj:
	* macosx/Makefile: reworked embedded build to no longer require
	relinking but to use install_name_tool instead to change the
	install_names for embedded frameworks. [Bug 644510]

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: preserve mod dates when running
	'make install' to build framework (avoids bogus rebuilds of dependent
	frameworks because tcl headers appear changed).

	* tests/ioCmd.test (iocmd-1.8): fix failure when system encoding is
	utf-8: use iso8859-1 encoding explicitly.

2003-02-18  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileExprWords): remove unused variable
	"range" [Bug 664743]
	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExprSrandFunc): remove unused variable
	"result" [Bug 664743]
	* generic/tclStringObj.c (UpdateStringOfString): remove unused
	variable "length" [Bug 664751]
	* tests/execute.test (execute-7.30): fix for [Bug 664775]

2003-02-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4: [Bug #651811] Added definition of _XOPEN_SOURCE and
	linkage of 'xnet' library to HP 11 branch. This kills a lot of
	socket-related failures in the testsuite when Tcl was compiled in 64
	bit mode (both PA-RISC 2.0W, and IA 64).

	* unix/configure: Regenerated.

2003-02-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (HaveVersion): correctly decl static

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpReaddir): reduce size of name string in tsd
	to NAME_MAX instead of PATH_MAX. [Bug 689100] (waters)

2003-02-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_THREADS): Make sure -lpthread gets passed on
	the link line when checking for the pthread_attr_setstacksize symbol.

2003-02-18  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c: cleanup of new 'simplefs' test code, and better
	documentation.

2003-02-17  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclRenameCommand): fixing error in previous
	commit.

2003-02-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode INST_STR_MATCH):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd STR_MATCH):
	* generic/tclUtf.c (TclUniCharMatch):
	* generic/tclInt.decls:  add private TclUniCharMatch function that
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: does string match on counted unicode
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: strings. Tcl_UniCharCaseMatch has the failing
	* tests/string.test:     that it can't handle strings or patterns with
	* tests/stringComp.test: embedded NULLs. Added tests that actually try
	strings/pats with NULLs. TclUniCharMatch should be TIPed and made
	public in the next minor version rev.

2003-02-17  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclRenameCommand): 'oldFullName' object was not
	being freed on all function exits, causing a memory leak. [Bug 684756]

2003-02-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_GetsObj): Minor change so that eol is only
	assigned at the top of the TCL_TRANSLATE_AUTO case block. The other
	cases assign eol so this does not change any functionality.

2003-02-17  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/notify.test: Removed Windows line terminators. [Bug 687913].

2003-02-15  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalEx):

	* tests/misc.test (1.2):
	* tests/parse.test (6.18):
	* tests/parseExpr.test (15.35):
	* tests/subst.test (8.6): Don Porter's fix for bad parsing of nested
	scripts. [Bug 681841]

2003-02-15  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/notify.test (new-file):
	* generic/tclTest.c (TclTest_Init, EventtestObjCmd, EventtestProc,
	(EventTestDeleteProc):
	* generic/tclNotify.c (Tcl_DeleteEvents): Fixed Tcl_DeleteEvents not
	to get a pointer smash when deleting the last event in the queue.
	Added test code in 'tcltest' and a new file of test cases
	'notify.test' to exercise this functionality; several of the new test
	cases fail for the original code and pass for the corrected code. [Bug
	673714]

	* unix/tclUnixTest.c (TestfilehandlerCmd): Corrected a couple of typos
	in error messages. [Bug 596027]

2003-02-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:		Bumped to version 8.4.2.
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* unix/configure:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tcl.spec:

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_GetCharLength): perf tweak

	* unix/tcl.m4: correct HP-UX ia64 --enable-64bit build flags

2003-02-14  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinTime.c: Added code to test and compensate for forward
	leaps of the performance counter. See the MSDN Knowledge Base article
	Q274323 for the hardware problem that makes this necessary on certain
	machines.
	* tests/winTime.test: Revised winTime-2.1 - it had a tolerance of
	thousands of seconds, rather than milliseconds. (What's six orders of
	magnitude among friends?) Both the above changes are triggered by a
	problem reported at:
	http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/ActiveTcl/1536811
	although the developers find it difficult to believe that it accounts
	for the observed behavior and suspect a fault in the RTC chip.

2003-02-13  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinInit.c: Added conversion from the system encoding to
	tcl_platform(user), so that it works with non-ASCII7 user names. [Bug
	685926]

	* doc/tclsh.1: Added language to describe the handling of the
	end-of-file character \u001a embedded in a script file. [Bug 685485]

2003-02-11  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileName.test:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c: fix for [Bug 685445] when using 'glob -l' on
	broken symbolic links. Added two new tests for this bug.

2003-02-11  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/http.test: Corrected a problem where http-4.14 would fail when
	run in an environment with a proxy server. Replaced references to
	scriptics.com by tcl.tk.

2003-02-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/lsearch.test:
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsearchObjCmd): protect against the case
	that lsearch -regepx list and pattern objects are equal.

	* tests/stringObj.test:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_GetCharLength): correct ascii char opt
	of 2002-11-11 to not stop early on \x00. [Bug 684699]

	* tests.parse.test: remove excess EOF whitespace

	* generic/tclParse.c (CommandComplete): more paranoid check to break
	on (p >= end) instead of just (p == end).

2003-02-11  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c (CommandComplete):
	* tests/parse.test: fix for [Bug 684744], by Don Porter.

2003-02-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSJoinPath, Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath):
	(UpdateStringOfFsPath): revert the cwdLen == 0 check and instead
	follow a different code path in Tcl_FSJoinPath.
	(Tcl_FSConvertToPathType, Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath):
	(Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath): Update string rep of path objects before
	freeing the internal object. (darley)

	* tests/fileSystem.test: added test 8.3
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath):
	(UpdateStringOfFsPath): handle the cwdLen == 0 case

	* unix/tclUnixFile.c (TclpMatchInDirectory): simplify the hidden file
	match check.

2003-02-10  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: Generate error when attempting to build under
	Cygwin. The Cygwin port of Tcl/Tk does not build and people are filing
	bug reports under the mistaken impression that someone is actually
	maintaining the Cygwin port. A post to comp.lang.tcl asking someone to
	volunteer as an area maintainer has generated no results. Closing bugs
	680840, 630199, and 634772 and marking as "Won't fix".

2003-02-10  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/append.n: Return value was not documented. [Bug 683188]

2003-02-10  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: further filesystem optimization, applying [Patch
	682500]. In particular, these code examples are faster now:
	    foreach f $flist { if {[file exists $f]} {file stat $f arr;...}}
	    foreach f [glob -dir $dir *] { # action and/or recursion on $f }
	    cd $dir
	    foreach f [glob *] { # action and/or recursion on $f }
	    cd ..

	* generic/tclTest.c: Fix for [Bug 683181] where test suite left files
	in 'tmp'.

2003-02-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/safe.tcl: code cleanup of eval and string comp use.

2003-02-07  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: cleanup long lines
	* win/tclWinFile.c: sped up pure 'glob' by a factor of 2.5
	('foreach f [glob *] { file exists $f }' is still slow)
	* tests/fileSystem.text:
	* tests/fileName.test: added new tests to ensure correct behaviour in
	optimized filesystem code.

2003-02-07  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* tests/fileSystem.text: fixed test 7.2 to avoid a possible crash, and
	not change the pwd.

	* tests/http.text: added comment to test 4.15, that it may fail if you
	use a proxy server.

2003-02-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileIncrCmd):
	* tests/incr.test: Don't include the text "(increment expression)" in
	the errorInfo generated by the compiled version of the incr command
	since it does not match the message generated by the non-compiled
	version of incr. It is also not possible to match this error output
	under Jacl, which does not support a compiler.

2003-02-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): When an error is
	encountered reading the increment value during a compiled call to
	incr, add a "(reading increment)" error string to the errorInfo
	variable. This makes the errorInfo variable set by the compiled incr
	command match the value set by the non-compiled version.
	* tests/incr-old.test: Change errorInfo result for the compiled incr
	command case to match the modified implementation.
	* tests/incr.test: Add tests to make sure the compiled and
	non-compiled errorInfo messages are the same.

2003-02-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:  Filename arguments to [outputChannel]
	and [errorChannel] (also -outfile and -errfile) were [open]ed but
	never [closed]. Also, [cleanupTests] could remove output or error
	files. [Bug 676978].
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl: Bumped to version 2.2.2.

2003-02-05  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/interp.test:
	* tests/set-old.test: Run test cases that depend on hash order through
	lsort so that the tests also pass under Jacl. Does not change test
	results under Tcl.

2003-02-04  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclEvent.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWinInit.c:
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* tests/fileSystem.test: fix to finalization/unloading/encoding issues
	to make filesystem much less dependent on encodings for its cleanup,
	and therefore allow it to be finalized later in the exit process. This
	fixes fileSystem.test-7.1. Also fixed one more bug in setting of
	modification dates of files which have undergone cross-platform
	copies. [Patch 676271]

	* tests/basic.test:
	* tests/exec.test:
	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/io.test: fixed some test failures when tests are run from a
	directory containing spaces.

	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* generic/tclTest.c: added regression test for the modification date
	setting of cross-platform file copies.

2003-02-03  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Changed [trace add command] so that 'rename'
	callbacks get fully qualified names of the command. [Bug 651271].
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	* tests/trace.test: Modified the test cases for [trace add command] to
	expect fully qualified names on the 'rename' callbacks. Added a case
	for renaming a proc within a namespace.
	* doc/trace.n: Added language about use of fully qualified names in
	trace callbacks.

2003-02-01  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: Removed an unused variable that caused
	compiler warnings on SGI. [Bug 664379]

	* generic/tclLoad.c: Changed the code so that if Tcl_StaticPackage is
	called to report the same package as being loaded in two interps, it
	shows up in [info loaded {}] in both of them (previously, it didn't
	appear in the static package list in the second).

	* tests/load.test Added regression test for the above bug. [Bug
	670042]

	* generic/tclClock.c: Fixed a bug that incorrectly allowed [clock
	clicks {}] and [clock clicks -] to be accepted as if they were [clock
	clicks -milliseconds].

	* tests/clock.test: Added regression tests for the above bug. [Bug
	675356]

	* tests/unixNotfy.test: Added cleanup of working files. [Bug 675609]

	* doc/Tcl.n: Added headings to the eleven paragraphs, to improve
	formatting in the tools that attempt to extract tables of contents
	from the manual pages. [Bug 627455]

	* generic/tclClock.c: Expanded mutex protection around the setting of
	env(TZ) and the thread-unsafe call to tzset(). [Bug 656660]

2003-01-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test: Cleaned up management of file/directory
	creation/deletion to improve "-debug 1" output. [Bug 675614]
	The utility [slave] command failed to properly [list]-quote a
	constructed [open] command, causing failure when the pathname
	contained whitespace. [Bug 678415]

	* tests/main.test: Stopped main.test from deleting existing file. Test
	suite should not delete files that already exist. [Bug 675660]

2003-01-28  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/main.test: Constrain tests that do not work on Windows. [Bug
	674387]

2003-01-28  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to setting modification date in
	TclCrossFilesystemCopy. Also added 'panic' in
	Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath under illegal calling circumstances which
	lead to hard-to-track-down bugs.

	* generic/tclTest.c: added test suite code to allow exercising a
	vfs-crash-on-exit bug in Tcl's finalization caused by the encodings
	being cleaned up before unloading occurs.
	* tests/fileSystem.test: added new 'knownBug' test 7.1 to demonstrate
	the crash on exit.

2003-01-28  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Add TCL_PREFIX_IDENT and TCL_DEBUG_IDENT, used only
	by TclpCreateProcess.
	* unix/Makefile.in: Define TCL_DBGX.
	* win/Makefile.in: Define TCL_DBGX.
	* win/tclWinPipe.c (TclpCreateProcess): Check that the Tcl pipe dll
	actually exists in the Tcl bin directory and panic if it is not found.
	Incorporate TCL_DBGX into the Tcl pipe dll name. This fixes a really
	mysterious error that would show up when exec'ing a 16 bit application
	under Win95 or Win98 when Tcl was compiled with symbols. The error
	seemed to indicate that the executable could not be found, but it was
	actually the Tcl pipe dll that could not be found.

2003-01-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update msys+mingw URL to release 6. This version bundles
	gcc 3.

2003-01-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Add test that checks to see if the compiler can
	cast to a union type.
	* win/tclWinTime.c: Squelch compiler warning about union initializer
	by casting to union type when compiling with gcc.

2003-01-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_CutChannel, Tcl_SpliceChannel): Invoke
	TclpCutFileChannel and TclpSpliceFileChannel.
	* generic/tclInt.h: Declare TclpCutFileChannel and
	TclpSpliceFileChannel.
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (FileCloseProc, TclpOpenFileChannel,
	(Tcl_MakeFileChannel, TclpCutFileChannel, TclpSpliceFileChannel):
	Implement thread load data cut and splice for file channels. This
	avoids an invalid memory ref when compiled with -DDEPRECATED.
	* win/tclWinChan.c (FileCloseProc, TclpCutFileChannel,
	(TclpSpliceFileChannel): Implement thread load data cut and splice for
	file channels. This avoids an invalid memory ref that was showing up
	in the thread extension.

2003-01-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace, squelch_warnings):
	* win/tclWinChan.c (Tcl_MakeFileChannel, squelch_warnings):
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, DoCopyFile, squelch_warnings):
	Re-implement inline ASM SEH handlers for gcc. The esp and ebp
	registers are now saved on the stack instead of in global variables so
	that the code is thread safe. Add additional checks when TCL_MEM_DEBUG
	is defined to be sure the values were recovered from the stack
	properly. Remove squelch_warnings functions and add a dummy call in
	the handler methods to squelch compiler warnings.

2003-01-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: Define HAVE_ALLOCA_GCC_INLINE when we detect that
	no alloca function is found in malloc.h and we are compiling with GCC.
	Remove HAVE_NO_ALLOC_DECL define.
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace): Don't define alloca as a
	cdecl function. Doing this caused a tricky runtime bug because the
	_alloca function expects the size argument to be passed in a register
	and not on the stack. To fix this problem, we use inline ASM when
	compiling with gcc to invoke _alloca with the size argument loaded
	into a register.

2003-01-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinDde.c (Dde_Init): clarified use of tsdPtr.
	(DdeServerProc): better refcount handling of returnPackagePtr.

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): revert finalize change on
	2002-12-04 to correct the issue with extensions that have TSD needing
	to finalize that before they are unloaded. This issue needs further
	clarification.

	* tests/unixFCmd.test: only do groups check on unix

2003-01-24  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c: proper fixes for Tcl_SetObjLength and
	Tcl_AttemptSetObjectLength dealing with string objects with both
	pure-unicode and normal internal representations. Previous fix didn't
	handle all cases correctly.
	* generic/tclIO.c: Add 'Tcl_GetString()' to ensure the object has a
	valid 'objPtr->bytes' field before manipulating it directly.

	This fixes [Bug 635200] and [Bug 671138], but may reduce performance
	of Unicode string handling in some cases. A further patch will be
	applied to address this, once the code is known to be correct.

2003-01-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Add test to see if alloca is undefined in
	malloc.h.
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace): Rework the SEH exception
	handler logic to avoid using the stack since alloca will modify the
	stack. This was causing a nasty bug that would set the exception
	handler to 0 because it tried to pop the previous exception handler
	off the top of the stack.

2003-01-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lset.n: Fixed fault in return values from lset in documentation
	examples [SF Bug #658463] and tidied up a bit at the same time.

2003-01-21  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/namespace.n (namespace inscope): Clarified documentation
	[Patch 670110]

2003-01-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Set SHLIB_SUFFIX so that
	TCL_SHLIB_SUFFIX will be set to a useful value in the generated
	tclConfig.sh. Set SHLIB_LD_LIBS to "" or '${LIBS}' based on the
	--enable-shared flag. This matches the UNIX implementation.

2003-01-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c: change %ud to %u as appropriate.

2003-01-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c (DdeServerProc): Deallocate the Tcl_Obj returned by
	ExecuteRemoteObject if it was not saved in a connection object.

2003-01-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Revert earlier change that defined TCL_WIDE_INT_TYPE
	as long long and TCL_LL_MODIFIER as L when compiling with mingw. This
	change ended up causing some test case failures when compiling with
	mingw.
	* generic/tclObj.c (UpdateStringOfWideInt): Describe the warning
	generated by mingw and why it needs to be ignored so that someone is
	not tempted to "fix" this problem again in the future.

2003-01-16  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c: Tcl_SetObjLength fix for when the object has
	a unicode string rep. [Bug 635200]
	* tests/stringObj.test: removed 'knownBug' constraint from test 14.1
	now that this bug is fixed.

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.z:
	* tests/trace.test: execution and command tracing bug fixes and
	cleanup. In particular fixed [Bug 655645], [Bug 615043], [Bug 571385]
	  - fixed some subtle cleanup problems with tracing. This required
	    replacing Tcl_Preserve/Tcl_Release with a more robust refCount
	    approach. Solves at least one known crash caused by memory
	    corruption.
	  - fixed some confusion in the code between new style traces (Tcl
	    8.4) and the very limited 'Tcl_CreateTrace' which existed before.
	  - made behaviour consistent with documentation (several tests even
	    contradicted the documentation before).
	  - fixed some minor error message details
	  - added a number of new tests

2003-01-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialOutputProc): add casts for bytesWritten to
	allow strict compilation (no warnings).

	* tests/winDde.test:
	* win/tclWinDde.c (Tcl_DdeObjCmd): Prevent crash when empty service
	name is passed to 'dde eval' and goto errorNoResult in request and
	poke error cases to free up any allocated data.

2003-01-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (squelch_warnings): Squelch compiler warnings from
	SEH ASM code.
	* win/tclWinChan.c (squelch_warnings): Squelch compiler warnings from
	SEH ASM code.
	* win/tclWinDde.c: Add casts to avoid compiler warnings. Pass pointer
	to DWORD instead of int to avoid compiler warnings.
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (squelch_warnings): Add casts and fixup decls to
	avoid compiler warnings. Squelch compiler warnings from SEH ASM code.
	* win/tclWinFile.c: Add casts and fixup decls to avoid compiler
	warnings. Remove unused variable.
	* win/tclWinNotify.c: Declare as DWORD instead of int to avoid
	compiler warning.
	* win/tclWinReg.c: Add casts to avoid compiler warning. Fix assignment
	in if expression bug.
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Add casts to avoid compiler warnings. Remove
	unused variable.
	* win/tclWinSock.c: Add casts and fixup decls to avoid compiler
	warnings.

2003-01-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclClock.c (FormatClock): corrected typo that incorrectly
	conditionally defined savedTZEnv and savedTimeZone.

2003-01-13  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fix mingw build problems and compiler warnings.

	* generic/tcl.h: Add if defined(__MINGW32__) check to code that sets
	the TCL_WIDE_INT_TYPE and TCL_LL_MODIFIER.
	* generic/tclClock.c (FormatClock): Don't define savedTimeZone and
	savedTZEnv if we are not going to use them.
	* generic/tclEnv.c: Add cast to avoid warning.
	* win/tclWinChan.c: Use DWORD instead of int to avoid compiler warning
	* win/tclWinThrd.c: Only define allocLock, allocLockPtr, and dataKey
	when TCL_THREADS is defined. This avoid a compiler warning about
	unused variables.

2003-01-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update msys + mingw URL, the new release includes the
	released 1.0.8 version of msys which includes a number of bug fixes.

2003-01-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Pull in addition of shell32.lib to
	LIBS_GUI that was added to the Tk tcl.m4 but never made it back into
	the Tcl version.

2003-01-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Skip Tcl's define of CHAR, SHORT, and LONG when
	HAVE_WINNT_IGNORE_VOID is defined. This avoids a bunch of compiler
	warnings when building with Cygwin or Mingw.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Define HAVE_WINNT_IGNORE_VOID when we detect a
	winnt.h that still defines CHAR, SHORT, and LONG when VOID has already
	been defined.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_LOAD_TCLCONFIG): Subst the TCL_DEFS loaded from
	tclConfig.sh so that Tcl defines can make it into the Tk Makefile.

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Check for typedefs like LPFN_ACCEPT in winsock2.h
	and define HAVE_NO_LPFN_DECLS if not found.
	* win/tclWinSock.c: Define LPFN_* typedefs if HAVE_NO_LPFN_DECLS is
	defined. This fixes the build under Mingw and Cygwin, it was broken by
	the changes made on 2002-11-26.

2003-01-10  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWinInit.c: fix to new WinTcl crash on exit with vfs,
	introduced on 2002-12-06. Encodings must be cleaned up after the
	filesystem.

	* win/makefile.vc: fix to minor VC++ 5.2 syntax problem

2003-01-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileReturnCmd):  Corrected off-by-one
	problem with recent commit. [Bug 633204]

2003-01-09  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: remove unused variable 'macSpecialCase'
	[Bug 664749]

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* tests/cmdAH.test: fix to non-ascii chars in paths when setting mtime
	and atime through 'file (a|m)time $path $time'. [Bug 634151]

2003-01-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExprFloatError):  Use the IS_NAN macro for
	greater clarity of code.

2003-01-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileReturnCmd):
	* tests/compile.test:	Corrects failure of bytecompiled [catch
	{return}] to have result TCL_RETURN (not TCL_OK) [Bug 633204]. This
	patch is a workaround for 8.4.X. A new opcode INST_RETURN is a better
	long term solution for 8.5 and later.

2003-01-04  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rules.vc:  Fixed INSTALLDIR macro problem that blanked itself by
	accident causing the install target to put the tree at the root of the
	drive built on. Whoops..

	Renamed the 'linkexten' option to be 'staticpkg'. Added 'thrdalloc' to
	allow the switching _on_ of the thread allocator. Under testing, I
	found it not to be benificial under windows for the purpose of the
	application I was using it for. It was more important for this app
	that resources for tcl threads be returned to the system rather than
	saved/moved to the global recycler. Be extra clean or extra fast for
	the default threaded build? Let's move to clean and allow it to be
	switched on for users who find it benificial for their use of threads.
