.SH NAME
linsert \- Insert elements into a list
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlinsert \fIlist index \fR?\fIelement element ...\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command produces a new list from \fIlist\fR by inserting all of the
\fIelement\fR arguments just before the \fIindex\fR'th element of
\fIlist\fR.  Each \fIelement\fR argument will become a separate element of
the new list.  If \fIindex\fR is less than or equal to zero, then the new
elements are inserted at the beginning of the list, and if \fIindex\fR is
greater or equal to the length of \fIlist\fR, it is as if it was \fBend\fR.
As with \fBstring index\fR, the \fIindex\fR value supports both simple index
arithmetic and end-relative indexing.
.PP
Subject to the restrictions that indices must refer to locations inside the
list and that the \fIelement\fRs will always be inserted in order, insertions
are done so that when \fIindex\fR is start-relative, the first \fIelement\fR
will be at that index in the resulting list, and when \fIindex\fR is
end-relative, the last \fIelement\fR will be at that index in the resulting
list.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Putting some values into a list, first indexing from the start and
then indexing from the end, and then chaining them together:
.PP
.CS
set oldList {the fox jumps over the dog}
set midList [\fBlinsert\fR $oldList 1 quick]
set newList [\fBlinsert\fR $midList end-1 lazy]
# The old lists still exist though...
set newerList [\fBlinsert\fR [\fBlinsert\fR $oldList end-1 quick] 1 lazy]
