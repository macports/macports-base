.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These four procedures all evaluate the expression
given by the \fIexpr\fR argument
and return the result in one of four different forms.
The expression can have any of the forms accepted by the \fBexpr\fR command.
Note that these procedures have been largely replaced by the
value-based procedures \fBTcl_ExprLongObj\fR, \fBTcl_ExprDoubleObj\fR,
\fBTcl_ExprBooleanObj\fR, and \fBTcl_ExprObj\fR.
Those value-based procedures evaluate an expression held in a Tcl value
instead of a string.
The value argument can retain an internal representation
that is more efficient to execute.
.PP
The \fIinterp\fR argument refers to an interpreter used to
evaluate the expression (e.g. for variables and nested Tcl
commands) and to return error information.
.PP
For all of these procedures the return value is a standard
Tcl result: \fBTCL_OK\fR means the expression was successfully
evaluated, and \fBTCL_ERROR\fR means that an error occurred while
evaluating the expression.
If \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned then
the interpreter's result will hold a message describing the error.
If an error occurs while executing a Tcl command embedded in
the expression then that error will be returned.
.PP
If the expression is successfully evaluated, then its value is
returned in one of four forms, depending on which procedure
is invoked.
\fBTcl_ExprLong\fR stores an integer value at \fI*longPtr\fR.
If the expression's actual value is a floating-point number,
then it is truncated to an integer.
If the expression's actual value is a non-numeric string then
an error is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_ExprDouble\fR stores a floating-point value at \fI*doublePtr\fR.
If the expression's actual value is an integer, it is converted to
floating-point.
If the expression's actual value is a non-numeric string then
an error is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_ExprBoolean\fR stores a 0/1 integer value at \fI*booleanPtr\fR.
If the expression's actual value is an integer or floating-point
number, then they store 0 at \fI*booleanPtr\fR if
the value was zero and 1 otherwise.
If the expression's actual value is a non-numeric string then
it must be one of the values accepted by \fBTcl_GetBoolean\fR
such as
.QW yes
or
.QW no ,
or else an error occurs.
.PP
\fBTcl_ExprString\fR returns the value of the expression as a
string stored in the interpreter's result.
