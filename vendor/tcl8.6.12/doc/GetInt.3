.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures convert from strings to integers or double-precision
floating-point values or booleans (represented as 0- or 1-valued
integers).  Each of the procedures takes a \fIsrc\fR argument,
converts it to an internal form of a particular type, and stores
the converted value at the location indicated by the procedure's
third argument.  If all goes well, each of the procedures returns
\fBTCL_OK\fR.  If \fIsrc\fR does not have the proper syntax for the
desired type then \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, an error message is left
in the interpreter's result, and nothing is stored at *\fIintPtr\fR
or *\fIdoublePtr\fR or *\fIboolPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetInt\fR expects \fIsrc\fR to consist of a collection
of integer digits, optionally signed and optionally preceded and
followed by white space.  If the first two characters of \fIsrc\fR
after the optional white space and sign are
.QW \fB0x\fR
then \fIsrc\fR is expected to be in hexadecimal form;  otherwise,
if the first such characters are
.QW \fB0o\fR
then \fIsrc\fR is expected to be in octal form;  otherwise,
if the first such characters are
.QW \fB0b\fR
then \fIsrc\fR is expected to be in binary form;  otherwise,
if the first such character is
.QW \fB0\fR
then \fIsrc\fR
is expected to be in octal form;  otherwise, \fIsrc\fR is
expected to be in decimal form.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetDouble\fR expects \fIsrc\fR to consist of a floating-point
number, which is:  white space;  a sign; a sequence of digits;  a
decimal point
.QW \fB.\fR ;
a sequence of digits;  the letter
.QW \fBe\fR ;
a signed decimal exponent;  and more white space.
Any of the fields may be omitted, except that
the digits either before or after the decimal point must be present
and if the
.QW \fBe\fR
is present then it must be followed by the exponent number. If there
are no fields apart from the sign and initial sequence of digits
(i.e., no decimal point or exponent indicator), that
initial sequence of digits should take one of the forms that
\fBTcl_GetInt\fR supports, described above. The use of
.QW \fB,\fR
as a decimal point is not supported nor should any other sort of
inter-digit separator be present.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetBoolean\fR expects \fIsrc\fR to specify a boolean
value.  If \fIsrc\fR is any of \fB0\fR, \fBfalse\fR,
\fBno\fR, or \fBoff\fR, then \fBTcl_GetBoolean\fR stores a zero
value at \fI*boolPtr\fR.
If \fIsrc\fR is any of \fB1\fR, \fBtrue\fR, \fByes\fR, or \fBon\fR,
then 1 is stored at \fI*boolPtr\fR.
Any of these values may be abbreviated, and upper-case spellings
are also acceptable.
