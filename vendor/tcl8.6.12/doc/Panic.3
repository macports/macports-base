.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
When the Tcl library detects that its internal data structures are in an
inconsistent state, or that its C procedures have been called in a
manner inconsistent with their documentation, it calls \fBTcl_Panic\fR
to display a message describing the error and abort the process.  The
\fIformat\fR argument is a format string describing how to format the
remaining arguments \fIarg\fR into an error message, according to the
same formatting rules used by the \fBprintf\fR family of functions.  The
same formatting rules are also used by the built-in Tcl command
\fBformat\fR.
.PP
In a freshly loaded Tcl library, \fBTcl_Panic\fR prints the formatted
error message to the standard error file of the process, and then
calls \fBabort\fR to terminate the process.  \fBTcl_Panic\fR does not
return. On Windows, when a debugger is running, the formatted error
message is sent to the debugger instead. If the windows executable
does not have a stderr channel (e.g. \fBwish.exe\fR), then a
system dialog box is used to display the panic message.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR may be used to modify the behavior of
\fBTcl_Panic\fR.  The \fIpanicProc\fR argument should match the
type \fBTcl_PanicProc\fR:
.PP
.CS
typedef void \fBTcl_PanicProc\fR(
        const char *\fBformat\fR,
        \fBarg\fR, \fBarg\fR,...);
.CE
.PP
After \fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR returns, any future calls to
\fBTcl_Panic\fR will call \fIpanicProc\fR, passing along the
\fIformat\fR and \fIarg\fR arguments. \fIpanicProc\fR should avoid
making calls into the Tcl library, or into other libraries that may
call the Tcl library, since the original call to \fBTcl_Panic\fR
indicates the Tcl library is not in a state of reliable operation.
.PP
The typical use of \fBTcl_SetPanicProc\fR arranges for the error message
to be displayed or reported in a manner more suitable for the
application or the platform.
.PP
Although the primary callers of \fBTcl_Panic\fR are the procedures of
the Tcl library, \fBTcl_Panic\fR is a public function and may be called
by any extension or application that wishes to abort the process and
have a panic message displayed the same way that panic messages from Tcl
will be displayed.
.PP
\fBTcl_PanicVA\fR is the same as \fBTcl_Panic\fR except that instead of
taking a variable number of arguments it takes an argument list.
