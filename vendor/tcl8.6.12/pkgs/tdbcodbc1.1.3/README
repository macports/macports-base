1. Introduction

This directory contains the source code, documentation, and test
scripts for the ODBC driver for Tcl Database Connectivity. This
module, plus TDBC itself, allow you to access ODBC databases using a
standard application programming interface (API) from a Tcl script.
This module is also available from http://tdbc.tcl.tk along with the
source code of TDBC itself. A bug database and Wiki are available at
the same location.

Tdbc::odbc is a freely-available open source package.  You can do
virtually anything you like with it, such as modifying it,
redistributing it, and selling it either in whole or in part.  See the
file "license.terms" for complete information.

2. Documentation

The 'doc' subdirectory in this release contains a set of reference
manual entries for tdbc::odbc.  Files with an extension '.n' are for
Tcl classes and commands; files with an extension '.3' are for C
library functions. The file, 'doc/tdbcodbc.n' gives an overview,
listing the classes and functions
