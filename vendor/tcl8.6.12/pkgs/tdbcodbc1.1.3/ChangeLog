	* tclconfig/install-sh:   Update to latest TEA
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4:
	* configure:		      autoconf-2.59

2012-07-13  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: A user asserts that certain 'output' parameters
	                      to SQLGetData must be initialized. While I have
	                      never seen the failure he reports, initializing
			      them appears to be Mostly Harmless, so do so.
			      (Bug [0dda7dbb73]).

2012-07-10  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Fixed a non-static table argument to

2012-05-07  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Fixed a crash when reporting SQLInstallError
	                      messages. pcbErrorMsg, documented to be
			      an output parameter, needs to be preinitialized
			      with the string length.

2011-08-30  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in:	Added a 'valgrind-sqlite' rule to allow for
			leak testing on Unix.
	* generic/odbcStubInit.c:
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c:	A round of memory leak hunting.  In the test
				suite, 6 'definitely lost' blocks remain,
				all of which at this point appear to be
				leaks in dependent libraries. Thanks to
				Giorgios Petasis for reporting the presence
				of the leaks and diagnosing two of them.
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl:	Corrected a typo in 'rename' statements that
				caused handles to leak (and potentially caused
				user commands to be deleted?)
	* tests/all.tcl:	Added [rename exit {}] for leak checking.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test:	Removed a useless [catch] on a cleanup
				operation.

2011-02-21  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (GetCell, HasBigintMethod, ResultSetConstructor):
		Fix a crash where an error is returned from SQLGetData.
	        Add a check for whether a connection supports 64-bit integers
		before trying to use them to replace NUMERIC or DECIMAL
		values. Add a method to determine 64-bit integer support.
		(Bug [8766b8dc40].)
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl (tdbc::odbc::connection typemap):
		Add to initialization a check for 64-bit integer support
		so that the above change works. (Bug [8766b8dc40].)
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test:
		Code formatting changes to avoid long lines and spurious
		semicolons.

2011-02-20  Kevin B, Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbc::odbc-30.[45]):
			Added tests for [allrows] and [foreach] on multiple
			result sets.

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (ResultSetNextresultsMethod):
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbc::odbc-{30.6,31.1}:
		Made 'rowcount' work for multiple result sets. Added a
		test for 'rowcount' in multiple result sets, and added
		a rudimentary test that stored procedures can be called.
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl (tdbc::odbc::resultset preparecall)
		Added a non-executed sketch of how a preparse of
		a prepared statement call might go in order to allow
		the use of SQLProcedureColumns to determine parameter
		directions. (This code may or may not be used; a first
		experiment would simply be to make all SP parameters
		'inout' and see if that works.)

2011-01-26  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/tdbc_odbc.n:
	Added empty comment at the start of each manpage because 'man'
	interprets comments there as directives. Thanks to Konstantin
	Kohmoutov for reporting and diagnosing this error.

2011-01-22  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* odbcStubDefs.txt: Added SQLMoreResults, needed for multiple result
	                    sets.
	* odbcStubInit.c:
	* odbcStubs.h:    make genstubs
	* tdbcodbc.c: Added a 'moreresults' method to the result set object
	              to allow for SQL statements that return multiple result
	              sets.
	              Fixed a resource leak in the case where bad parameters
	              are supplied to the 'foreignkeys' method.
	* tdbcodbc.test: Added tests that the 'moreresults' method works
	                 correctly in the event of 0, 1, and more than one
	                 result set.

2010-09-03  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tdbcodbc.test: Made tests more portable.

	* generic/odbcStubDefs.txt:
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c:
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl:
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test:
			Added the 'primarykeys' and 'foreignkeys' methods,
			and the corresponding tests.
	* generic/odbcStubInit.c:
	* generic/odbcStubs.h:
			make genstubs

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	* pkgIndex.tcl.in (new file):
	* README:
	* tclconfig/:	Upgraded the build to use TEA 3.9. Changed the
			approach to pkgIndex.tcl generation. (It's now built
			at configure time, rather than from the Makefile.)
			Advanced version number to 1.0b16.

	* configure: 	autoconf 2.59

2010-06-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in:			Revised the code at the suggestion
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c:		of Andreas Kupries to avoid using
	* tests/all.tcl:		'tcl_findLibrary' and instead execute
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test:		both 'source' and 'load' commands from
					'pkgIndex.tcl'. Revised the 'make test'
					rule, and the test scripts, to
					test successfully under the new regime.
					Thanks to Andreas for providing the
					original patch, and to Joe English
					for providing ideas for simplifying
					and repairing 'make test' under the
					new regime.

2010-05-12  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/fakesql.h:
			Eliminated uses of INT64 and UINT64 in
			favour of Tcl_WideInt and Tcl_WideUInt
			respectively.  (Avoids a conflict with
			INT64 and UINT64 definitions in basetsd.h
			on Win64.)

2010-05-10  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* aclocal.m4:	Synchronized with the 'tdbc' package.
	* configure.in: Advanced release to 1.0b15 and TEA version to 3.7.
			Added code to detect VC++ and include the stub
			library by path rather than with -L and -l.
	* generic/fakesql.h:
			Corrected syntax of INSTAPI specifiers.
	* generic/odbcStubDefs.txt:
			Added a CONVENTION: SQL_API line so that
			genExtStubs.tcl can get the syntax right on the
			pointer-to-function declarations.
	* generic/odbcStubInit.txt:
			Corrected syntax of INSTAPI specifiers. Regenerated.
	* generic/odbcStubs.h:
			Regenerated.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c:
			Silenced several VC++ warnings.
	* README:	Advanced release to 1.0b15.
	* tclconfig/:	Advanced to TEA 3.7
	* configure:	autoconf-2.59

2010-05-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Makefile.in: Removed attempt to generate a stub library. Drivers
	  do not export stub tables.

2010-04-30  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in: Added missing files to 'make dist.' Added a 'genstubs'
	               rule to automate building of the Stubs table from the
		       ODBC library added at run time.
	* generic/fakesql.h:
	* generic/odbcStubDefs.txt:
	* generic/odbcStubInit.c:
		Fixed DOS line endings.

2010-04-25  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in:
	* README:       Advance version to 1.0b14
	* configure:    autoconf 2-59

2010-04-10  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:  Added code to specify to 'make test' and 'make shell'
	                the value of TDBC_LIBRARY, needed for
	                [package require tdbc] to work. This library is
	                either the 'library' subdirectory of the TDBC source
	                directory (when running from an un-installed TDBC)
	                or else the TDBC library directory in the installed
	                Tcl.
	* configure: autoconf 2.59

2010-04-08  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Revised TDBC_ names to be tdbc_, because that's
	what TEA_LOAD_CONFIG does. Added a check to find 'tdbc.h' in the
	build directory if necessary.

	* configure: autoconf 2.59.

2010-03-17  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/odbcStubInit.c: Revised TIP 357 API yet again, adding a
	'flags' parameter to Tcl_LoadFile.

2010-03-15  Kevin B. Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/odbcStubInit.c: Adjusted to revised TIP 357 API.

2010-03-14  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Removed all dependency on the native ODBC headers
	and import libraries. All ODBC references are now resolved at
	run time and contained in a 'fakesql.h' file. Removed references to
	Tk as well.
	* configure: autoconf-2.59
	* generic/fakesql.h (new file): Added file containing declarations
	of all ODBC API's used in this package, to avoid dependence on native
	headers.
	* generic/odbcStubsDefs.txt (new file): Declarations of functions
	imported from odbc32.dll using Tcl_LoadLibrary.
	* generic/odbcStubInit.c (new file): Code to load odbc32.dll and
	odbccp32.dll and initialize Stubs tables with the routines in them
	that are used in tdbc::odbc.
	* generic/odbcStubs.h (new file): Generated .h file with the Stubs
	structure defined in generic/odbcStubsDefs.txt.
	* tdbcodbc.c: Updated to use run-time-loaded ODBC libraries instead
	of associating to system headers at compile time and import libraries
	at link time. Revised handling of the '-parent' option so that the
	dependence on Tk is only at run time.

2009-09-29  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in:		Changed 'test' rule to test all available
				database types.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test:	Changed all TEST_* env vars to TDBCODBC_*
				for easier top-level scripting.  Clarified
				and expanded database type selection.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c:   Replaced SQLSetConnectAttr with the obsolete
				SQLSetConnectOption, for better compatibility
				with older ODBC drivers.

2009-09-20  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:
	* configure.in:		Advance version number to 1.0b13
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

2009-07-02  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile.in:		Added testing on SQL Server Express so that
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: 	more functionality and data types can be
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test:	exposed.  Added code to force column names
				in result sets to be unique.

	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl: Conditioned use of the IS_NULLABLE hack
	                        on the driver's not returning the NULLABLE
	                        flag in [$db columns]. This conditional
	                        fixes bug 3e523335bb, which fails when
				IS_NULLABLE is padded to a fixed length with
	 			spaces.
	* README:
	* configure.in:		Advanced version to 1.0b12
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

2009-05-29  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:
	* configure.in:		Advanced version to 1.0b11
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (GetCell): Corrected a problem where
	results longer than the preallocated buffer length had spurious
	NULL characters inserted. Corrected a subsequent problem where
	BLOBs had *missing* characters. (The ODBC documentation lies about
	terminating NULL bytes.)
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (odbc-27.[12]): Corrected a problem where
	BLOB and MEMO tests didn't actually test anything.
	Thanks to Alan Grunwald for reporting these bugs

2009-04-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/tdbc_odbc.n: Added missing documentation for 'new' constructors.

2009-04-18  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/tdbc_odbc.n: Made changes so that NROFF formatting matches
	                   the Tcl standard.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Changed so that all variable access failures
			      are mapped to NULL rather than passing errors
			      throught the interp.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Adjusted test cases for inappropriate access
			       to array variables.

2009-04-16  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:
	* configure.in:		Advanced version to 1.0b10
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

2009-03-03  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c:
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl: Replaced 'my variable' with variables at
	class level.  Replaced 'init' methods with constructors implemented
	in C.  Replaced 'statementClass' and 'resultSetClass' variables
	with forwarded 'statementCreate' and 'resultSetCreate' methods.

2009-02-16  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:
	* configure.in:		Advanced version to 1.0b9
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

	* Makefile.in: Removed useless TCL_VERSION_REQ test in the
	               pkgIndex.tcl.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (GetCell):
		Fixed bad bug in retrieving LONGVARCHAR, LONGVARBINARY,
		CLOB, BLOB, etc. (The SQL_NO_TOTAL return was not being
		handled, resulting in infinite loops, memory corruption,
		or NULLS in place of the actual data.)
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbc::odbc-27.1):
		Added a test case for the above bug.
		Thanks to Patrick Dunnigan for the bug report.

2009-02-14  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in:
	* README:		Advance verwsion to 1.0b8
	* configure:		autoconf-2.59

	* doc/tdbc_odbc.n:	Formatting changes so that man2html works.

	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbc::odbc-26.1):
				Removed superfluous difference between
				SQLite and non-SQLite tests - all now
				return the same SQLSTATE.

2009-02-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (StatementInitMethod): Corrected a bad check
	that caused SQLDescribeParam to be bypassed entirely. Corrected
	bad code that was exposed by this fix (SQLDescribeParam failure was
	handled incorrectly). Corrected the error code for variables in
	native SQL syntax.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Corrected error codes for seven tests, to
	match the [try]-friendly error code syntax.

2009-01-31  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* README:	Advanced version to 1.0b7
	* configure.in:
	* configure:	autoconf 2.59
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Revised error codes to be more [try]-friendly.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Added test cases for revised error codes,
	and for an uncovered branch in ODBC statement error handling.

2008-12-05  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (DatasourceObjCmd):
	Added the tdbc::odbc::datasource command for adding, configuring
	and removing data sources.

2008-12-04  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodc.c (ResultSetInitMethod, GetCell):
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbc::odbc-21.2): Added direct transfer of
	BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY parameters and results.

2008-12-03  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbodbc.c:     Added "tdbc::odbc::datasources" and
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl:  "tdbc::odbc::drivers" for inspection of
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test:   available databases.

2008-12-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Added '-encoding' and -timeout' options.
	Added direct transfer (rather than stringization) of parameters
	of integer and floating point types.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test (tdbc::odbc-19.*): Added rudimentary
	configuration tests, and rudimentary tests of direct value
	transfers C <-> SQL.

2008-11-30  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Changed PACKAGE_NAME to lowercase 'tdbcodbc'
			Changed PACKAGE_VERSION to 0.2a1
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4:
			Look in a few additional places for dependent packages.
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl: Lowercased the 'tdbc' package and advanced the
	                        version number on which tdbcodbc depends.
			        Added code to detect whether the connection
	                        supports Unicode.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Added '-isolation' and '-readonly' configuration
		              options. Added code to use Unicode if possible
			      for columns of unknown type and wide-character
			      columns. Changed the script-level package name
			      to tdbc::odbc.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Changed the script-level package name to
			       tdbc::odbc. Renamed all tests accordingly.
	* Makefile.in: Changed the script-level package name to tdbc::odbc
	               for building pkgIndex.tcl
	* test.mdb: Reverted a commit that corrupted this file.

2008-11-22  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Changed configurator so that 8.6 no longer requires a
	dummy tclooConfig.h.
	* configure: Autoconf 2.61

2008-06-15  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c:
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Removed the default check for Tk. Instead,
	added a '-parent window' option to the constructor of
	tdbc::odbc::connection that gives a parent window for the
	driver manager dialog.
	Added a 'configure' method to the connection object, and
	rudimentary tests. (No configuration options yet implemented)

2008-06-11  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tdbcodbc.c: Split [$resultset nextrow] into two primitive
	methods: [$resultset nextlist] and [$resultset nextdict]. Refactored
	a little bit of the code that handles result sets.

2008-05-24  Kevin B Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* configure.in: Changed configuration to use TEA_PATH_CONFIG to
	* aclocal.m4:   locate tcloo and tdbc.  Removed the local code that
	                did it from aclocal.m4.
	* configure:    Autoconf 2.61

2008-05-13  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* Makefile (deleted): Removed a superfluous file from an
		earlier stage of development.
	* generic/tdbcodbc.c (TablesStmtInitMethod,ResultSetNextrowMethod):
		Removed a cut-and-paste error in TablesStmtInitMethod that
		caused a pointer smash, and added a cast to silence a gcc
		warning. Changed the 'init2' method on the 'statement'
		class back to 'init' now that TclOO seems to be getting
		method resolution correct.
	* library/tdbcodbc.tcl (tdbc::sqlite::statement constructor):
		Changed the 'init2' method on 'statement' back to
		'init' now that TclOO seems to be getting method resolution
		correct.
	* tests/tdbcodbc.test: Corrected misnumbering of tests, and added
