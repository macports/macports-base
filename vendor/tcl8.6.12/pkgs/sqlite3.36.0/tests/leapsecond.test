# This file contains a testcase which checks whether sqlite3
# can parse a ISO-8601 timestap containing a leap second. Last
# leap second (to date) happened at "2012-06-30 23:59:60", which
# is a perfectly valid time-stap, but stock sqlite cannot handle that.
#
# This file is put into public domain, under the same terms as the
# rest of the SQLite code.
