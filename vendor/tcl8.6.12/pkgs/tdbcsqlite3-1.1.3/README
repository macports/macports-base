1. Introduction

This directory contains the source code, documentation, and test
scripts for the SQLite3 driver for Tcl Database Connectivity. This
module, plus TDBC and SQLite3 themselves, allow you to access SQLite3
databases using a standard application programming interface (API)
from a Tcl script.  This module is also available from
http://tdbc.tcl.tk along with the source code of TDBC itself. A bug
database and Wiki are available at the same location.

Tdbc::sqlite3 is a freely-available open source package.  You can do
virtually anything you like with it, such as modifying it,
redistributing it, and selling it either in whole or in part.  See the
file "license.terms" for complete information.

2. Documentation

The 'doc' subdirectory in this release contains a set of reference
manual entries for tdbc::sqlite3.  Files with an extension '.n' are for
Tcl classes and commands; files with an extension '.3' are for C
library functions. The file, 'doc/tdbcsqlite3.n' gives an overview,
listing the classes and functions
