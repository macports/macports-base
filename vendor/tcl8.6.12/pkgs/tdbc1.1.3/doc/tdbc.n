.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Tcl Database Connectivity (TDBC) is a common interface for Tcl
programs to access SQL databases. It is implemented by a series of
database \fIdrivers\fR: separate modules, each of which adapts Tcl to
the interface of one particular database system.  All of the drivers
implement a common series of commands for manipulating the database.
These commands are all named dynamically, since they all represent
objects in the database system. They include \fBconnections,\fR
which represent connections to a database; \fBstatements,\fR which
represent SQL statements, and \fBresult sets,\fR which represent
the sets of rows that result from executing statements. All of these
have manual pages of their own, listed under \fBSEE ALSO\fR.
.PP
In addition, TDBC itself has a few service procedures that are chiefly
of interest to driver writers. \fBSEE ALSO\fR also enumerates them.
