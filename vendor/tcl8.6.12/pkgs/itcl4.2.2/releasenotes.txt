This is the release 4.1.2 of Itcl.

It is intended to be script compatible with Itcl 4.0.* and Itcl 3.4.* .
It very likely presents the same public C interface as Itcl 4.0.* .
It includes incompatible changes to internal structs when compared
with Itcl 4.0.* .  Unfortunately, the extension Itk 4.0.* intrudes
in those internals and will notice and break in the presence of Itcl 4.1.* .
When you upgrade to Itcl 4.1 , you must also upgrade to Itk 4.1 .  It
is possible you will find other extensions and applications repeating Itk's
error.
