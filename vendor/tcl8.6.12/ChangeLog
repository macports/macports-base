A NOTE ON THE CHANGELOG:
Starting in early 2011, Tcl source code has been under the management of
fossil, hosted at https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/ .  Fossil presents a "Timeline"
view of changes made that is superior in every way to a hand edited log file.
Because of this, many Tcl developers are now out of the habit of maintaining
this log file.  You may still find useful things in it, but the Timeline is
a better first place to look now.
============================================================================

	Tcl_SetNotifier() change.

2013-07-02  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	issue.

2013-06-17  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/regc_locale.c: Bug [a876646efe]: re_expr character class
	[:cntrl:] should contain \u0000 - \u001f

2013-06-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmdsSZ.c (TclCompileTryCmd): [Bug 779d38b996]:
	Rewrote the [try] compiler to generate better code in some cases and
	to behave correctly in others; when an error happens during the
	processing of an exception-trap clause or a finally clause, the
	*original* return options are now captured in a -during option, even
	when fully compiled.

2013-06-05  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_EXPAND_DROP): [Bugs 2835313, 3614226]:
	New opcode to allow resetting the stack to get rid of an expansion,
	restoring the stack to a known state in the process.
	* generic/tclCompile.c, generic/tclCompCmds.c: Adjusted the compilers
	for [break] and [continue] to get stack cleanup right in the majority
	of cases.

2013-06-04  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4: Eliminate NO_VIZ macro as current zlib uses HAVE_HIDDEN
	instead. One more last-moment fix for FreeBSD by Pietro Cerutti

2013-06-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: fix for perf bug detected by Kieran
	(https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/vfpI3bc-DkQ),
	diagnosed by dgp to be a close relative of [Bug 781585], which was
	fixed by commit	[f46fb50cb3]. This bug was introduced by myself in
	commit [cbfe055d8c].

2013-06-03  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileBreakCmd, TclCompileContinueCmd):
	Added code to allow [break] and [continue] to be issued as a jump (in
	the most common cases) rather than using the more expensive exception
	processing path in the bytecode engine. [Bug 3614226]: Partial fix for
	the issues relating to cleaning up the stack when dealing with [break]
	and [continue].

2013-05-27 Harald Oehlmann  <oehhar@users.sf.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl: [Bug 3036566]: Also get locale from
	registry key HCU\Control Panel\Desktop : PreferredUILanguages to honor

	native cc to error out.

2013-05-22  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclUtf.c (TclUtfCasecmp): [Bug 3613609]: Replace problematic
	uses of strcasecmp with a proper UTF-8-aware version. Affects both
	[lsearch -nocase] and [lsort -nocase].

2013-05-22  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/file.n: [Bug 3613671]: Added note to portability section on the
	fact that [file owned] does not produce useful results on Windows.

2013-05-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (DefaultTempDir): [Bug 3613567]: Corrected logic
	for checking return code of access() system call, which was inverted.

2013-05-19  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4:     Fix for FreeBSD, and remove support for older
	* unix/configure:  FreeBSD versions. Patch by Pietro Cerutti.

2013-05-18  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmdsGR.c: Split tclCompCmds.c again to keep size of
	code down.

2013-05-16  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Add panic in order to detect incompatible
	mingw32 sys/stat.h and sys/time.h headers.

2013-05-13  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* compat/zlib/*: Upgrade to zlib 1.2.8

2013-05-10  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	Optimizations and general bytecode generation improvements.
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileAppendCmd, TclCompileLappendCmd):
	(TclCompileReturnCmd): Make these generate bytecode in more cases.
	(TclCompileListCmd): Make this able to push a literal when it can.
	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclSetByteCodeFromAny, PeepholeOptimize):
	Added checks to see if we can apply some simple cross-command-boundary
	optimizations, and defined a small number of such optimizations.
	(TclCompileScript): Added the special ability to compile the list
	command with expansion ([list {*}blah]) into bytecode that does not
	call an external command.

2013-05-06  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclStubInit.c: Add support for Cygwin64, which has a 64-bit
	* generic/tclDecls.h: "long" type. Binary compatibility with win64
	requires that all stub entries use 32-bit long's, therefore the need
	for various wrapper functions/macros. For Tcl 9 a better solution is
	needed, but that cannot be done without introducing binary
	incompatibility.

2013-04-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/platform/platform.tcl (::platform::LibcVersion):
	* library/platform/pkgIndex.tcl: Followup to the 2013-01-30 change.
	The RE become too restrictive again. SuSe added a timestamp after the
	version. Loosened up a bit. Bumped package to version 1.0.12.

2013-04-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileArraySetCmd): Generate better code
	when the list of things to set is a literal.

2013-04-25  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDecls.h: Implement Tcl_NewBooleanObj, Tcl_DbNewBooleanObj
	and Tcl_SetBooleanObj as macros using Tcl_NewIntObj, Tcl_DbNewLongObj
	and Tcl_SetIntObj. Starting with Tcl 8.5, this is exactly the same, it
	only eliminates code duplication.
	* generic/tclInt.h: Eliminate use of NO_WIDE_TYPE everywhere: It's
	exactly the same as TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG

2013-04-19  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDecls.h: Implement many Tcl_*Var* functions and
	Tcl_GetIndexFromObj as (faster/stack-saving) macros around resp their
	Tcl_*Var*2 equivalent and Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct.

2013-04-12  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDecls.h: Implement Tcl_Pkg* functions as
	(faster/stack-saving) macros around Tcl_Pkg*Ex functions.

2013-04-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/regc_color.c:	[Bug 3610026]: Stop crash when the number of
	* generic/regerrs.h:	"colors" in a regular expression overflows a
	* generic/regex.h:	short int.  Thanks to Heikki Linnakangas for
	* generic/regguts.h:	the report and the patch.
	* tests/regexp.test:

2013-04-04  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::geturl): Allow URLs that don't have a
	path, but a query query, e.g. http://example.com?foo=bar

2013-03-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/regc_nfa.c:	[Bugs 3604074,3606683]: Rewrite of the

	providing the test-case and the patch.

2013-02-26  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/chanio.test (chan-io-28.7): [Bug 3605120]: Stop test from
	hanging when run standalone.

2013-02-26  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c: Don't panic if Tcl_ConvertToType is called for a

	((((((((a)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)* .  Thanks to Bjørn Grathwohl for discovery.

2013-02-14  Harald Oehlmann  <oehhar@users.sf.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl: [Bug 3604576]: Catch missing registry
	entry "HCU\Control Panel\International".
	Bumped msgcat version to 1.5.1

2013-02-11  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c (ZlibTransformOutput): [Bug 3603553]: Ensure that
	data gets written to the underlying stream by compressing transforms
	when the amount of data to be written is one buffer's-worth; problem
	was particularly likely to occur when compressing large quantities of
	not-very-compressible data. Many thanks to Piera Poggio (vampiera) for
	reporting.

2013-02-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	maximum depth of recursion used when duplicating an automaton in
	response to encountering a "wild" RE that hit the previous limit.
	Allow the limit (DUPTRAVERSE_MAX_DEPTH) to be set by defining its
	value in the Makefile. Problem reported by Jonathan Mills.

2013-02-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c:	[Bug 3603434]: Make sure TclpObjNormalizePath()

	present on the system.

2013-02-05  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclLoadNone.c (TclpLoadMemory): [Bug 3433012]: Added dummy

	can load from memory but cannot actually do so due to it being
	disabled at configuration time.

2013-02-04  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileArraySetCmd): [Bug 3603163]: Stop

2013-01-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/platform/platform.tcl (::platform::LibcVersion): See
	* library/platform/pkgIndex.tcl: [Bug 3599098]: Fixed the RE
	* unix/Makefile.in: extracting the version to avoid issues with
	* win/Makefile.in: recent changes to the glibc banner. Now targeting a
	less variable part of the string. Bumped package to version 1.0.11.

2013-01-28  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileArraySetCmd)
	(TclCompileArrayUnsetCmd, TclCompileDictAppendCmd)

	(TclCompileDictUnsetCmd, TclCompileDictUpdateCmd)
	(TclCompileDictWithCmd, TclCompileInfoCommandsCmd):
	* generic/tclCompCmdsSZ.c (TclCompileStringMatchCmd)
	(TclCompileStringMapCmd): Improve the code generation in cases where

	fault on Darwin.

2013-01-23  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::geturl): [Bug 2911139]: Do not do vwait
	for connect to avoid reentrancy problems (except when operating
	without a -command option). Internally, this means that all sockets
	created by the http package will always be operated in asynchronous
	mode.

2013-01-21  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls: Put back Tcl[GS]etStartupScript(Path|FileName)
	in private stub table, so extensions using this (like Tk 8.4) will
	continue to work in all Tcl 8.x versions. Extensions using this
	still cannot be compiled against Tcl 8.6 headers.

2013-01-18  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclPort.h: [Bug 3598300]: unix: tcl.h does not include
	sys/stat.h

2013-01-17  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (PushVarName): [Bug 3600328]: Added mechanism
	for suppressing compilation of variables when we couldn't cope with
	the results. Useful for some [array] subcommands.
	* generic/tclEnsemble.c (CompileToCompiledCommand): Must restore the
	compilation environment when a command compiler fails.

2013-01-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c (TclZlibInit): [Bug 3601086]: Register the config
	info in the iso8859-1 encoding as that is guaranteed to be present.

2013-01-16  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* Makefile.in:   Allow win32 build with -DTCL_NO_DEPRECATED, just as
	* generic/tcl.h: in the UNIX build. Define Tcl_EvalObj and
	* generic/tclDecls.h: Tcl_GlobalEvalObj as macros, even when
	* generic/tclBasic.c: TCL_NO_DEPRECATED is defined, so Tk can benefit
	from it too.

2013-01-14  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tcl.m4: More flexible search for win32 tclConfig.sh, backported
	from TEA (not actually used in Tcl, only for Tk)

2013-01-14  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls: Put back Tcl_[GS]etStartupScript in internal
	stub table, so extensions using this, compiled against 8.5 headers
	still run in Tcl 8.6.

2013-01-13  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/fileevent.n: [Bug 3436609]: Clarify readable fileevent "false
	positives" in the case of multibyte encodings/transforms.

2013-01-13  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: If TCL_NO_DEPRECATED is defined, make sure
	that TIP #139 functions all are taken from the public stub table, even
	if the inclusion is through tclInt.h.

2013-01-12  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls: Put back TclBackgroundException in internal
	stub table, so extensions using this, compiled against 8.5 headers
	still run in Tcl 8.6.

2013-01-09  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl: [Bug 3599395]: http assumes status line is a
	proper Tcl list.

2013-01-08  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: [Bug 3092089]: [file normalize] can remove path
	components.	[Bug 3587096]: win vista/7: "can't find init.tcl" when
	called via junction without folder list access.

2013-01-07  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOStubLib.c: Restrict the stub library to only use
	* generic/tclTomMathStubLib.c: Tcl_PkgRequireEx, Tcl_ResetResult and
	Tcl_AppendResult, not any other function. This puts least restrictions
	on eventual Tcl 9 stubs re-organization, and it works on the widest
	range of Tcl versions.

2013-01-06  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl: Don't depend on Spencer-specific regexp
	* tests/env.test: syntax (/u and /U) any more in unrelated places.
	* tests/exec.test:
	Bump http package to 2.8.6.

2013-01-04  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclEnsemble.c (CompileBasicNArgCommand): Added very simple
	compiler (which just compiles to a normal invoke of the implementation
	command) for many ensemble subcommands where we can prove that there
	is no way for scripts to detect the difference even through error
	handling or [info level]/[info frame]. This improves the code produced
	from some ensembles (e.g., [info], [string]) to the point where the
	ensemble is now not normally seen at the bytecode level at all.

2013-01-04  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:      Insure that PURIFY builds cannot exploit the
	* generic/tclExecute.c:  Tcl stack to hide mem defects.

2013-01-03  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/fconfigure.n, doc/CrtChannel.3: Updated to reflect the fact that
	the minimum buffer size is one byte, not ten. Identified by Schelte
	Bron on the Tcler's Chat.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBCresume:INST_INVOKE_REPLACE):
	* generic/tclEnsemble.c (TclCompileEnsemble): Added new mechanism to
	allow for more efficient dispatch of non-bytecode-compiled subcommands
	of bytecode-compiled ensembles. This can provide substantial speed
	benefits in some cases.

2013-01-02  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclEnsemble.c:  Remove stray calls to Tcl_Alloc and friends:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:   the core should only use ckalloc to allow
	* generic/tclIORTrans.c:  MEM_DEBUG to work properly.
	* generic/tclTomMathInterface.c:

2012-12-31  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/string.n: Noted the obsolescence of the 'bytelength',
	'wordstart' and 'wordend' subcommands, and moved them to later in the
	file.

2012-12-27  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	objifying a zero-length DString. Spotted by afredd.

2012-12-21  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/dltest/pkgb.c:  Inline compat Tcl_GetDefaultEncodingDir.
	* generic/tclStubLib.c: Eliminate unnecessary static HasStubSupport()
	and isDigit() functions, just do the same inline.

2012-12-18  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmdsSZ.c (TclSubstCompile): Improved the sequence of
	instructions issued for [subst] when dealing with simple variable
	references.

2012-12-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	*** 8.6.0 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

2012-12-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c:	Repair same issue with misusing the
	* tests/zlib.test:	'fire and forget' nature of Tcl_ObjSetVar2
	in the new TIP 400 implementation.

2012-12-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:	(CatchObjCmdCallback): do not decrRefCount
	* tests/cmdAH.test:	the newValuePtr sent to Tcl_ObjSetVar2:
	TOSV2 is 'fire and forget', it decrs on its own.
	Fix for [Bug 3595576], found by andrewsh.

2012-12-13  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Fix Tcl_DecrRefCount macro such that it doesn't
	access its objPtr parameter twice any more.

2012-12-10  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl (plus-pkgs): Increased robustness of
	version number detection code to deal with packages whose names are
	prefixes of other packages.
	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): Added pkgs/package.list.txt to distribution
	builds to ensure that 'make html' will work better.

2012-12-09  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/chan.test: Clean up unwanted eofchar side-effect of chan-4.6
	leading to a spurious "'" at end of chan.test under certain conditions
	(see [Bug 3389289] and [Bug 3389251]).

	* doc/expr.n: [Bug 3594188]: Clarifications about commas.

2012-12-08  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c: Fix busyloop at exit under TCL_FINALIZE_ON_EXIT
	when there are unflushed nonblocking channels.  Thanks Miguel for
	spotting.

2012-12-07  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/dltest/pkgb.c:  Turn pkgb.so into a Tcl9 interoperability test
        library: Whatever Tcl9 looks like, loading pkgb.so in Tcl 9 should
        either result in an error-message, either succeed, but never crash.

2012-11-28  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c (ZlibStreamSubcmd): [Bug 3590483]: Use a mechanism
	for complex option resolution that has fewer problems with more
	finicky compilers.

2012-11-26  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c: Factor out creation of the -sockname and
	-peername lists from TcpGetOptionProc() to TcpHostPortList().  Make it
	robust against implementations of getnameinfo() that error out if
	reverse mapping fails instead of falling back to the numeric
	representation.

2012-11-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBinary.c (BinaryDecode64): [Bug 3033307]: Corrected
	handling of trailing whitespace when decoding base64. Thanks to Anton
	Kovalenko for reporting, and Andy Goth for the fix and tests.

2012-11-19  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_STR_RANGE_IMM): [Bug 3588366]: Corrected

	range]. Thanks to Emiliano Gavilan for diagnosis and fix.

2012-11-15  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	IMPLEMENTATION OF TIP#416

	New Options for 'load': -global and -lazy

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclLoad.c
	* unix/tclLoadDl.c
	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c
	* tests/load.test
	* doc/Load.3
	* doc/load.n

2012-11-14  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (TclUnixOpenTemporaryFile): [Bug 2933003]: Factor
	out all the code to do temporary file creation so that it is possible
	to make it correct in one place. Allow overriding of the back-stop
	default temporary file location at compile time by setting the
	TCL_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY #def to a string containing the directory
	name (defaults to "/tmp" as that is the most common default).

2012-11-13  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* win/tclWinInit.c: also search for the library directory (init.tcl,
	encodings, etc) relative to the build directory associated with the
	source checkout.

2012-11-10  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:   re-enable bcc-tailcall, after fixing an
	* generic/tclExecute.c: infinite loop in the TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG mode

2012-11-06  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::Finish): [Bug 3581754]: Ensure that
	callbacks are done at most once to prevent problems with timeouts on a
	keep-alive connection (combined with reentrant http package use)
	causing excessive stack growth. Not a fix for the underlying problem,
	but ensures that pain will be mostly kept away from users.
	Bump http package to 2.8.5.

2012-11-05  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	Added bytecode compilation of many Tcl commands. Some of these are
	total compilations and some are only partial (i.e., only compile in
	some cases). The (sub-)commands affected are:
	* array: exists, set, unset
	* dict: create, exists, merge
	* format: (simple cases only)
	* info: commands, coroutine, level, object
	* info object: class, isa object, namespace
	* namespace: current, code, qualifiers, tail, which
	* regsub: (only cases convertable to simple [string map])
	* self: (only no-argument and [self object] cases)
	* string: first, last, map, range
	* tailcall:
	* yield:

	[This was work originally done on the 'dkf-compile-misc-info' branch.]

2012-11-05  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	IMPLEMENTATION OF TIP#413

	Align the [string trim] and [string is space] commands, such that
	[string trim] by default trims all characters for which [string is
	space] returns 1, augmented with the NUL character.

	* generic/tclUtf.c: Add NEL, BOM and two more characters to [string is
	space]
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Modify [string trim] for Unicode modifications.
	* generic/regc_locale.c: Regexp engine must match [string is space]
	* doc/string.n
	* tests/string.test
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	Code that relied on characters not previously trimmed being not
	removed will notice a difference; it is believed that this is rare,
	but a workaround to get the behavior in Tcl 8.5 is to use " \t\n\r" as
	an explicit trim set.

2012-10-31  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/Makefile.in:   Dde version number to 1.4.0, ready for Tcl 8.6.0rc1
	* win/makefile.vc
	* win/tclWinDde.c
	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl
	* tests/winDde.test

2012-10-24  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileDictUnsetCmd): Added compilation of
	the [dict unset] command (for scalar var in LVT only).

2012-10-23  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:       Add "flags" parameter from Tcl_LoadFile to
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:    to various internal functions, so these
	* generic/tclLoadNone.c:  flags are available through the whole
	* unix/tclLoad*.c:        filesystem for (future) internal use.
	* win/tclWinLoad.c:

2012-10-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclNRCoroutineObjCmd): insure that numlevels
	are properly set, fix bug discovered by dkf and reported at
	http://code.activestate.com/lists/tcl-core/12213/

2012-10-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	IMPLEMENTATION OF TIP#405

	New commands for applying a transformation to the elements of a list
	to produce another list (the [lmap] command) and to the mappings of a
	dictionary to produce another dictionary (the [dict map] command). In
	both cases, a [continue] will cause the skipping of an element/pair,
	and a [break] will terminate the construction early and successfully.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_LmapObjCmd, TclNRLmapCmd): Implementation of
	the new [lmap] command, based on (and sharing much of) [foreach].
	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictMapNRCmd): Implementation of the new [dict
	map] subcommand, based on (and sharing much of) [dict for].
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileLmapCmd, TclCompileDictMapCmd):
	Compilation engines for [lmap] and [dict map].

	IMPLEMENTATION OF TIP#400

	* generic/tclZlib.c: Allow the specification of a compression
	dictionary (a binary blob used to seed the compression engine) in both
	streams and channel transformations. Also some reorganization to allow
	for getting gzip header dictionaries and controlling buffering levels
	in channel transformations (allowing a trade-off between formal
	correctness and speed).
	(Tcl_ZlibStreamSetCompressionDictionary): New C API to allow setting
	the compression dictionary without using a Tcl script.

2012-10-14  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c: [Bug 3576509]: ::tcl::Bgerror crashes with
	* generic/tclEvent.c:    invalid arguments. Better fix, which helps
	for all Tcl_DictObjGet() calls in Tcl's source code.

2012-10-13  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclEvent.c: [Bug 3576509]: tcl::Bgerror crashes with invalid
	arguments

	with msys 0.8.

2012-10-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c:	When checking for std channels being closed,
	compare the channel state, not the channel itself so that stacked
	channels do not cause trouble.

2012-09-26  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* generic/tclIOSock.c (TclCreateSocketAddress): Work around a bug in
	getaddrinfo() on OSX that caused name resolution to fail for [socket
	-server foo -myaddr localhost 0].

2012-09-20  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* compat/zlib/win32/zdll.lib:
	* compat/zlib/win64/zdll.lib:

	* win/tclWinDde.c: [FRQ 3527238]: Full unicode support for dde. Dde

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***

2012-09-19  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:  Make Tcl_Interp a fully opaque structure if
	TCL_NO_DEPRECATED is set (TIP 330 and 336).
	* win/nmakehlp.c: Let "nmakehlp -V" start searching digits after the
	found match (suggested by Harald Oehlmann).

2012-09-19  Harald Oehlmann  <oehhar@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinSock.c (InitializeHostName): Corrected logic that
	extracted the name of the computer from the gethostname call so that
	it would use the name on success, not failure. Also ensured that the
	buffer size is exactly that recommended by Microsoft.

2012-07-08  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* library/http/http.tcl: [Bug 3531209]: Add fix and test for URLs that
	* tests/http.test: 	 contain literal IPv6 addresses.

2012-07-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c:	[Bug 1189293]: Make "<<" binary safe.
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:

2012-07-03  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclDStringAppendObj, TclDStringAppendDString):
	* generic/tclInt.h (TclDStringAppendLiteral, TclDStringClear):
	* generic/tclCompile.h (TclDStringAppendToken): Added wrappers to make
	common cases of appending to Tcl_DStrings simpler to write. Prompted
	by looking at [FRQ 1357401] (these are an _internal_ implementation of
	that FRQ).

2012-06-29  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:   Add tn, ro_MO and ru_MO to msgcat.

2012-06-29  Harald Oehlmann <oehhar@users.sf.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:	[Bug 3536888]: Locale guessing of

	* unix/Makefile.in:		to 1.4.5
	* win/Makefile.in:

2012-06-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/GetIndex.3: Reinforced the description of the requirement for
	the tables of names to index over to be static, following posting to
	tcl-core by Brian Griffin about a bug caused by Tktreectrl not obeying
	this rule correctly. This does not represent a functionality change,
	merely a clearer documentation of a long-standing constraint.

2012-06-26  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4:       Let Cygwin shared build link with
	* unix/configure.in: zlib1.dll, not cygz.dll (two less
	* unix/configure:    dependencies on cygwin-specific dll's)
	* unix/Makefile.in:

2012-06-26  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* generic/tclIOSock.c: Use EAI_SYSTEM only if it exists.
	* unix/tclUnixSock.c:

2012-06-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileSystem.h:	[Bug 3024359]: Make sure that the
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:	per-thread cache of the list of file systems
	* generic/tclPathObj.c:	currently registered is only updated at times
	when no active loops are traversing it.  Also reduce the amount of
	epoch storing and checking to where it can make a difference.

2012-06-25  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (EncodingDirsObjCmd): [Bug 3537605]: Do the right

2012-06-25  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclfileName.c: [Patch 1536227]: Cygwin network pathname

2012-06-23  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: [Bug 3508771]: Cygwin notifier for handling

2012-06-22  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* generic/tclIOSock.c: Rework the error message generation of [socket],
	* unix/tclUnixSock.c:  so that the error code of getaddrinfo is used
	* win/tclWinSock.c:    instead of errno unless it is EAI_SYSTEM.

2012-06-21  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinReg.c:	[Bug 3362446]: registry keys command fails

	* tests/proc.test:	hash table can tolerate either order of
	teardown, interp first, or Proc first.

2012-06-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure.in:	Update autogoo for gettimeofday().
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:	Thanks Joe English.
	* unix/configure:	autoconf 2.13

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:	[Bug 3530533]: Centralize #include <pthread.h>
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:	in the tclUnixPort.h header so that old unix
	systems that need inclusion in all compilation units are supported.

2012-06-08  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c:    Revise the "null data" check: null strings are
	possible, but empty binary arrays are not.
	* tests/winDde.test:  Add test-case (winDde-9.4) for transferring
	null-strings with dde. Convert tests to tcltest-2 syntax.

2012-06-06  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c (TclZlibInit): Declare that Tcl is publishing the
	zlib package (version 2.0) as part of its bootstrap process. This will
	have an impact on tclkit (which includes zlib 1.1) but otherwise be
	very low impact.

2012-06-06  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: On Cygwin, use win32 API in stead of uname()
	to determine the tcl_platform variables.

2012-05-31  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c:  [Bug 3530536]: zlib-7.4 fails on IRIX64
	* tests/zlib.test:
	* doc/zlib.n:         Document that [stream checksum] doesn't do
	what's expected for "inflate" and "deflate" formats

2012-05-31  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* library/safe.tcl (safe::AliasFileSubcommand): Don't assume that
	slaves have corresponding commands, as that is not true for
	sub-subinterpreters (used in Tk's test suite).

	* doc/safe.n: [Bug 1997845]: Corrected formatting so that generated
	HTML can link properly.

	* tests/socket.test (socket*-13.1): Prevented intermittent test
	failure due to race condition.

2012-05-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/expr.n, doc/mathop.n: [Bug 2931407]: Clarified semantics of
	division and remainder operators.

2012-05-29  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c:    [Bug 3525762]: Encoding handling in dde.
	* win/Makefile.in:    Fix "make genstubs" when cross-compiling on UNIX

2012-05-28  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* library/safe.tcl (safe::AliasFileSubcommand): [Bug 3529949]: Made a
	more sophisticated method for preventing information leakage; it
	changes references to "~user" into "./~user", which is safe.

2012-05-25  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/namespace.n, doc/Ensemble.3: [Bug 3528418]: Document what is
	going on with respect to qualification of command prefixes in ensemble
	subcommand maps.

	* generic/tclIO.h (SYNTHETIC_EVENT_TIME): Factored out the definition
	of the amount of time that should be waited before firing a synthetic
	event on a channel.

2012-05-25  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c: [Bug 473946]: Special characters were not correctly
	sent, now for XTYP_EXECUTE as well as XTYP_REQUEST.
	* win/Makefile.in: Fix "make genstubs" when cross-compiling on UNIX

2012-05-24  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:  Take cygwin handling of X11 into account.
	* generic/tcl*Decls.h: re-generated
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:  Implement TclpIsAtty, Cygwin only.
	* doc/dde.n: Doc fix: "dde execute iexplore" doesn't work
	without -async, because iexplore doesn't return a value

2012-05-24  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:   Let cygwin share stub table with win32
	* win/tclWinSock.c:     implement TclpInetNtoa for win32
	* generic/tclInt.decls: Revert most of [3caedf05df], since when
	  we let cygwin share the win32 stub table this is no longer necessary
	* generic/tcl*Decls.h:  re-generated
	* doc/dde.n:            1.3 -> 1.4

2012-05-23  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c (ZlibTransformInput): [Bug 3525907]: Ensure that
	decompressed input is flushed through the transform correctly when the
	input stream gets to the end. Thanks to Alexandre Ferrieux and Andreas
	Kupries for their work on this.

2012-05-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:	When using Tcl_SetObjLength() calls to
	* generic/tclPathObj.c:		grow and shrink the objPtr->bytes
	buffer, care must be taken that the value cannot possibly become pure
	Unicode.  Calling Tcl_AppendToObj() has the possibility of making such
	a conversion.  Bug found while valgrinding the trunk.

2012-05-21  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	IMPLEMENTATION OF TIP#106

	* win/tclWinDde.c:		Added encoding-related abilities to
	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:	the [dde] command. The dde package's
	* tests/winDde.test:		version is now 1.4.0.
	* doc/dde.n:

2012-05-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOBasic.c (TclOO_Class_Constructor): [Bug 2023112]: Cut
	the amount of hackiness in class constructors, and refactor some of
	the error message handling from [oo::define] to be saner in the face
	of odd happenings.

2012-05-17  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SwitchObjCmd): [Bug 3106532]: Corrected
	resulting indexes from -indexvar option to be usable with [string
	range]; this was always the intention (and is consistent with [regexp
	-indices] too).
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	Uses of [switch -regexp -indexvar] that previously compensated for the
	wrong offsets (by subtracting 1 from the end indices) now do not need
	to do so as the value is correct.

	* library/safe.tcl (safe::InterpInit): Ensure that the module path is
	constructed in the correct order.
	(safe::AliasGlob): [Bug 2964715]: More extensive handling of what
	globbing is required to support package loading.

	* doc/expr.n: [Bug 3525462]: Corrected statement about what happens
	when comparing "0y" and "0x12"; the previously documented behavior was
	actually a subtle bug (now long-corrected).

2012-05-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (TclMakeFileCommandSafe): [Bug 3445787]: Improve
	the compatibility of safe interpreters' version of 'file' with that of
	unsafe interpreters.
	* library/safe.tcl (::safe::InterpInit): Teach the safe-interp scripts
	about how to expose 'file' properly.

2012-05-13  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c:   Protect against receiving strings without ending
	\0, as external applications (or Tcl with TIP #106) could generate
	that.

2012-05-10  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c: [Bug 473946]: Special characters not correctly sent
	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:  Increase version to 1.3.3

2012-05-10  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* {win,unix}/configure{,.in}: [Bug 2812981]: Clean up bundled
	packages' build directory from within Tcl's ./configure, to avoid
	stale configuration.

2012-05-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIORChan.c: [Bug 3522560]: Fixed the crash, enabled the
	test case. Modified [chan postevent] to properly inject the event(s)
	into the owner thread's event queue for execution in the correct
	context. Renamed the ForwardOpTo...Thread() function to match with our
	terminology.

	* tests/ioCmd.test: [Bug 3522560]: Added a test which crashes the core
	if it were not disabled as knownBug. For a reflected channel
	transfered to a different thread the [chan postevent] run in the
	handler thread tries to execute the owner threads's fileevent scripts
	by itself, wrongly reaching across thread boundaries.

2012-04-28  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c: Properly close nonblocking channels even when
	not flushing them.

2012-05-03  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* compat/zlib/*: Upgrade to zlib 1.2.7 (pre-built dll is still 1.2.5,
	will be upgraded as soon as the official build is available)

2012-05-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/socket.test:	[Bug 3428754]: Test socket-14.2 tolerate
	[socket -async] connection that connects synchronously.

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c:	[Bug 3428753]: Fix [socket -async] connections
	that manage to connect synchronously.

2012-05-02  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/configure.in:    Better detection and implementation for
	* generic/configure:       cpuid instruction on Intel-derived
	* generic/tclUnixCompat.c: processors, both 32-bit and 64-bit.
	* generic/tclTest.c:       Move cpuid testcase from win-specific to
	* win/tclWinTest.c:        generic tests, as it should work on all
	* tests/platform.test:     Intel-related platforms now.

2012-04-30  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/ioCmd.test: [Bug 3522560]: Tame deadlocks in broken refchan
	tests.

2012-04-28  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	IMPLEMENTATION OF TIP#398

	* generic/tclIO.c: Quickly Exit with Non-Blocking Blocked Channels
	* tests/io.test  : *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
	* doc/close.n    : (compat flag available)

2012-04-27  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclPort.h:    Move CYGWIN-specific stuff from tclPort.h to
	* generic/tclEnv.c:     tclUnixPort.h, where it belongs.
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:

2012-04-27  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* library/init.tcl (auto_execok): Allow shell builtins to be detected
	even if they are upper-cased.

2012-04-26  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclStubInit.c:    Get rid of _ANSI_ARGS_ and CONST
	* generic/tclIO.c:
	* generic/tclIOCmd.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c:

2012-04-25  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclDStringToObj): Added internal function to make
	the fairly-common operation of converting a DString into an Obj a more
	efficient one; for long strings, it can just transfer the ownership of
	the buffer directly. Replaces this:
	   obj=Tcl_NewStringObj(Tcl_DStringValue(&ds),Tcl_DStringLength(&ds));
	   Tcl_DStringFree(&ds);
	with this:
	   obj=TclDStringToObj(&ds);

2012-04-24  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

2012-04-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3 (Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc): [Bug 3518244]: Fixed
	documentation of this filesystem callback function; it must not
	register its created channel - that's the responsibility of the caller
	of Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel - as that leads to reference leaks.

2012-04-15  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclEnsemble.c (NsEnsembleImplementationCmdNR):
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSEvalFileEx): Cut out levels of the C

2012-04-10  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h (TCL_DEPRECATED_API): [Bug 2458976]: Added macro that
	can be used to mark parts of Tcl's API as deprecated. Currently only
	used for fields of Tcl_Interp, which TIPs 330 and 336 have deprecated
	with a migration strategy; we want to encourage people to move away
	from those fields.

2012-04-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOODefineCmds.c (ClassVarsSet, ObjVarsSet): [Bug 3396896]:
	Ensure that the lists of variable names used to drive variable
	resolution will never have the same name twice.

	* generic/tclVar.c (AppendLocals): [Bug 2712377]: Fix problem with
	reporting of declared variables in methods. It's really a problem with
	how [info vars] interacts with variable resolvers; this is just a bit
	of a hack so it is no longer a big problem.

2012-04-04  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOO.c (Tcl_NewObjectInstance, TclNRNewObjectInstance):
	[Bug 3514761]: Fixed bogosity with automated argument description
	handling when constructing an instance of a class that is itself a
	member of an ensemble. Thanks to Andreas Kupries for identifying that
	this was a problem case at all!
	(Tcl_CopyObjectInstance): Fix potential bleed-over of ensemble

	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: Implement TclWinGetTclInstance,
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:     TclpGetTZName, and various more
	win32-specific internal functions for Cygwin, so win32 extensions
	using those can be loaded in the cygwin version of tclsh.

2012-03-30  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4:        [Bug 3511806]: Compiler checks too early

	* generic/tclOO.c (Tcl_CopyObjectInstance): [Bug 3474460]: Make the
	target object name optional when copying classes. [RFE 3485060]: Add
	callback method ("<cloned>") so that scripted control over copying is
	easier.
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	If you'd previously been using the "<cloned>" method name, this now
	has a standard semantics and call interface. Only a problem if you are
	also using [oo::copy].

	and programmability at the script-level. Introduce new [::oo::Slot]
	class which is the implementation of these things.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	The unknown method handler now may be asked to deal with the case
	where no method name is provided at all. The default implementation
	generates a compatible error message, and any override that forces the
	presence of a first argument (i.e., a method name) will continue to
	function as at present as well, so this is a pretty small change.

	* generic/tclOOBasic.c (TclOO_Object_Destroy): Made it easier to do a
	tailcall inside a normally-invoked destructor; prevented leakage out
	to calling command.

	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:  changes from [835f8e1e9d] (2010-01-22).
	* win/tclWinError.c:          They were an attempt to make the cygwin
	                              port compile again, but since cygwin is
	                              based on unix this serves no purpose any
	                              more.
	* win/tclWinSerial.c:         Use EAGAIN in stead of EWOULDBLOCK,

	                              EWOULDBLOCK is no longer the same as
	                              EAGAIN.

	be misleading.

	* tests/thread.test: Remove unnecessary [after] calls from the thread
	tests.  Make error message matching more robust for tests that may
	have built-in race conditions.  Test thread-7.26 must first unset all
	thread testing related variables.  Revise results of the thread-7.28
	through thread-7.31 tests to account for the fact they are canceled
	via a script sent to the thread asynchronously, which then impacts the
	error message handling.  Attempt to manually drain the event queue for
	the main thread after joining the test thread to make sure no stray
	events are processed at the wrong time on the main thread.  Revise all
	the synchronization and comparison semantics related to the thread id
	and error message.

2011-11-18  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* tests/thread.test: Remove all use of thread::release from the thread
	7.x tests, replacing it with a script that can easily cause "stuck"
	threads to self-destruct for those test cases that require it.  Also,
	make the error message handling far more robust by keeping track of
	every asynchronous error.

2011-11-17  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* tests/thread.test: Refactor all the remaining thread-7.x tests that
	were using [testthread].  Note that this test file now requires the
	very latest version of the Thread package to pass all tests.  In
	addition, the thread-7.18 and thread-7.19 tests have been flagged as

	make the main [file] command hidden by default in safe interpreters,
	because that's what existing code expects. This will reduce the amount
	which the code breaks, but not necessarily eliminate it...

2011-09-23  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIORTrans.c: More revisions to get finalization of
	ReflectedTransforms correct, including adopting a "dead" field as was
	done in tclIORChan.c.

	* tests/thread.test:	Stop using the deprecated thread management
	commands of the tcltest package.  The test suite ought to provide
	these tools for itself.  They do not belong in a testing harness.

2011-09-22  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:	Revise [info frame] so that it stops creating
	cycles in the iPtr->cmdFramePtr stack.

2011-09-22  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/re_syntax.n: [Bug 2903743]: Add more magic so that we can do at
	least something sane on Solaris.
	* tools/tcltk-man2html-utils.tcl (process-text): Teach the HTML
	generator how to handle this magic.

2011-09-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c: Revise the thread exit handling of the
	[testthread] command so that it properly maintains the per-process
	data structures even when the thread exits for reasons other than the
	[testthread exit] command.

2011-09-21  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclIO.c: [Bug 3412487]: Now short reads are allowed in
	synchronous fcopy, avoid mistaking them as nonblocking ones.

2011-09-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIORTrans.c (ForwardOpToOwnerThread): Fixed the missing
	initialization of the 'dsti' field. Reported by Don Porter, on chat.

2011-09-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIORChan.c: Re-using the "interp" field to signal a dead
	channel (via NULL value) interfered with conditional cleanup tasks
	testing for "the right interp". Added a new field "dead" to perform
	the dead channel signalling task so the corrupted logic is avoided.

	* generic/tclIORTrans.c: Revised ReflectClose() and
	FreeReflectedTransform() so that we stop leaking ReflectedTransforms,
	yet free all Tcl_Obj values in the same thread that alloced them.

2011-09-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/ioTrans.test:	Conversion from [testthread] to Thread package
	stops most memory leaks.

	* tests/thread.test:	Plug most memory leaks in thread.test.
	Constrain the rest to be skipped during `make valgrind'.  Tests using
	the [testthread cancel] testing command are leaky.  Corrections wait
	for either addition of [thread::cancel] to the Thread package, or
	improvements to the [testthread] testing command to make leak-free
	versions of these tests possible.

	* generic/tclIORChan.c:	Plug all memory leaks in ioCmd.test exposed
	* tests/ioCmd.test:	by `make valgrind'.
	* unix/Makefile.in:

	* generic/tclProc.c (ProcWrongNumArgs): [Bugs 3400658,3408830]:
	Ensemble-like rewriting of error messages is complex, and TclOO (in

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::geturl): [Bug 3391977]: Ensure that the

	be duplicated).

2011-09-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

2011-09-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c: [Bug 3401704]: Allow function names like

	form NUMBER + FUNCTION.

	[Bug 3398794]: Ensure that low-level conditions in the limit API are

	* generic/tclInt.h: Fixed the inadvertently committed disabling of
	stack checks, see my 2010-11-15 commit.

2011-06-22  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	Merge from rmax-ipv6-branch:
	* unix/tclUnixSock.c: Fix [socket -async], so that all addresses
	returned by getaddrinfo() are tried, not just the first one. This
	requires the event loop to be running while the async connection is in
	progress. ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	* tests/socket.test: Add a test for the above.
	* doc/socket: Document the fact that -async needs the event loop
	* generic/tclIOSock.c: AI_ADDRCONFIG is broken on HP-UX

2011-06-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclLink.c:	[Bug 3317466]: Prevent multiple links to a

2011-06-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStrToD.c:  [Bug 3315098]: Mem leak fix from Gustaf
	Neumann.

2011-06-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Reverted the fix for [Bug 3274728] committed
	on 2011-04-06 and replaced with one which is 64bit-safe. The existing
	fix crashed tclsh on Windows 64bit.

2011-06-08  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/fileSystem.test: Reduce the amount of use of duplication of
	complex code to perform common tests, and convert others to do the
	test result check directly using Tcltest's own primitives.

2011-06-06  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tests/socket.test: Add test constraint, so 6.2 and 6.3 don't fail
	when the machine does not have support for ip6. Follow-up to checkin
	from 2011-05-11 by rmax.

2011-06-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Removed TclCleanupLiteralTable(), and old
	* generic/tclInt.h:	band-aid routine put in place while a fix for
	* generic/tclLiteral.c:	[Bug 994838] took shape.  No longer needed.

2011-06-02  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h (TclInvalidateNsCmdLookup): [Bug 3185407]: Extend
	the set of epochs that are potentially bumped when a command is
	created, for a slight performance drop (in some circumstances) and
	improved semantics.

2011-06-01  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Using the two free data elements in NRCommand to
	store objc and objv - useful for debugging.

2011-06-01  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c:   Fix for [Bug 3309871]: Valgrind finds: invalid
	read in TclMaxListLength().

2011-05-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:	  Use a complete growth algorithm for lists so
	* generic/tclListObj.c:	  that length limits do not overconstrain by a
	* generic/tclStringObj.c: factor of 2.  [Bug 3293874]: Fix includes
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	  rooting all growth routines by default on a
	common tunable parameter TCL_MIN_GROWTH.

2011-05-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:	Bump to msgcat 1.4.4.

	* generic/tclOOBasic.c, generic/tclOOCall.c, generic/tclOOInfo.c,
	* generic/tclOOInt.h, tests/oo.test, tests/ooNext2.test: Added
	introspection of call chains ([self call], [info object call], [info
	class call]) and ability to skip ahead in chain ([nextto]).

2011-05-24  Venkat Iyer <venkat@comit.com>

	* library/tzdata/Africa/Cairo: Update to Olson tzdata2011g

2011-05-24  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl (msgcat::mcset, msgcat::mcmset): Remove
	some useless code; [dict set] builds dictionary levels for us.

2011-05-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclFixupForwardJump): Tracked down and fixed
	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclArgumentBCEnter): the cause of a violation of
	my assertion that 'ePtr->nline == objc' in TclArgumentBCEnter.  When a
	bytecode was grown during jump fixup the pc -> command line mapping
	was not updated. When things aligned just wrong the mapping would
	direct command A to the data for command B, with a different number of
	arguments.

2011-05-11  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c (TcpWatchProc): No need to check for server
	sockets here, as the generic server code already takes care of that.
	* tests/socket.test (accept): Add tests to make sure that this remains
	so.

2011-05-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:     New internal routines TclScanElement() and
	* generic/tclUtil.c:    TclConvertElement() are rewritten guts of
	machinery to produce string rep of lists.  The new routines avoid and
	correct [Bug 3173086].  See comments for much more detail.

	* generic/tclDictObj.c:         Update all callers.
	* generic/tclIndexObj.c:
	* generic/tclListObj.c:
	* generic/tclUtil.c:

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (NamespacePathCmd): Convert to use Tcl_Obj API
	* generic/tclPkg.c (Tcl_PackageObjCmd):   for result generation in
	* generic/tclTimer.c (Tcl_AfterObjCmd):   [after info], [namespace
	path] and [package versions].

2011-05-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclListObj.c:	Revise empty string tests so that we avoid
	potentially expensive string rep generations, especially for dicts.

2011-05-07  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclLoad.c (TclGetLoadedPackages): Convert to use Tcl_Obj API
	for result generation.

2011-05-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: Fix USE_TCLALLOC so that it can be enabled without
	* unix/Makefile.in: editing the Makefile.

2011-05-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclListObj.c:	Stop generating string rep of dict when
	converting to list.  Tolerate NULL interps more completely.

2011-05-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c:	Tighten Tcl_SplitList().
	* generic/tclListObj.c:	Tighten SetListFromAny().
	* generic/tclDictObj.c:	Tighten SetDictFromAny().
	* tests/join.test:
	* tests/mathop.test:

2011-05-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	Revised TclFindElement() interface. The final
	* generic/tclDictObj.c:	argument had been bracePtr, the address of a
	* generic/tclListObj.c:	boolean var, where the caller can be told
	* generic/tclParse.c:	whether or not the parsed list element was
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	enclosed in braces.  In practice, no callers
	really care about that.  What the callers really want to know is
	whether the list element value exists as a literal substring of the
	string being parsed, or whether a call to TclCopyAndCollpase() is
	needed to produce the list element value.  Now the final argument is
	changed to do what callers actually need. This is a better fit for the
	calls in tclParse.c, where now a good deal of post-processing checking
	for "naked backslashes" is no longer necessary.
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	For any callers calling in via the internal stubs table who really do
	use the final argument explicitly to check for the enclosing brace
	scenario.  Simply looking for the braces where they must be is the
	revision available to those callers, and it will backport cleanly.

	* tests/parse.test:	Tests for expanded literals quoting detection.

	* generic/tclCompCmdsSZ.c:	New TclFindElement() is also a better
	fit for the [switch] compiler.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Replace TclCountSpaceRuns() with
	* generic/tclListObj.c:	TclMaxListLength() which is the function we
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	actually want.
	* generic/tclCompCmdsSZ.c:

	* generic/tclCompCmdsSZ.c: Rewrite of parts of the switch compiler to
	better use the powers of TclFindElement() and do less parsing on its
	own.

2011-04-28  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:	New utility routines:
	* generic/tclParse.c:	TclIsSpaceProc() and TclCountSpaceRuns()
	* generic/tclUtil.c:

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	Use new routines to replace calls to isspace()

	* generic/tclUtf.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:

	* generic/tcl.h:       fix for [Bug 3288345]: Wrong Tcl_StatBuf
	* generic/tclInt.h:    used on MinGW. Make sure that all _WIN32
	* win/tclWinFile.c:    compilers use exactly the same layout
	* win/configure.in:    for Tcl_StatBuf - the one used by MSVC6 -
	* win/configure:       in all situations.

2011-04-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

2011-04-18  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/dict.n: [Bug 3288696]: Command summary was confusingly wrong
	when it came to [dict filter] with a 'value' filter.

2011-04-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclFCmd.c (TclFileAttrsCmd): Add comments to make this code
	easier to understand. Added a panic to handle the case where the VFS
	layer does something odd.

2011-04-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c:	[Bug 3285375]: Rewrite of Tcl_Concat*()
	routines to prevent segfaults on buffer overflow.  Build them out of
	existing primitives already coded to handle overflow properly.  Uses
	the new TclTrim*() routines.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	New internal utility routines TclTrimLeft()
	* generic/tclInt.h:	and TclTrimRight().  Refactor the
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	[string trim*] implementations to use them.

2011-04-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: [Bug 2662380]: Fix crash caused by appending to a
	variable with a write trace that unsets it.

2011-04-13  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_ConcatObj): [Bug 3285375]: Make the crash
	less mysterious through the judicious use of a panic. Not yet properly
	fixed, but at least now clearer what the failure mode is.

2011-04-12  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/string.test:	Test for [Bug 3285472]. Not buggy in trunk.

2011-04-12  Venkat Iyer <venkat@comit.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclNREvalObjEx): fix performance issue, notably
	apparent in tclbench's "LIST lset foreach". Many thanks to Twylite for

	allocation and free macros.

2011-03-24  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclFCmd.c (TclFileAttrsCmd): Ensure that any reference to

	Unable to test, since both forms work on my machine in VC2005, 2008,
	2010, in both release and debug builds.
	* tests/tclTest.c (TestdstringCmd): Restored MSVC buildability broken

	from 'char*' to 'void*'.

2011-03-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: remove TEBCreturn()

2011-03-12  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h (ckalloc,ckfree,ckrealloc): Moved casts into these
	macro so that they work with VOID* (which is a void* on all platforms
	which Tcl actually builds on) and unsigned int for the length
	parameters, removing the need for MANY casts across the rest of Tcl.
	Note that this is a strict source-level-only change, so size_t cannot
	be used (would break binary compatibility on 64-bit platforms).

2011-03-12  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: [Bug 3185609]: File normalization corner case

	* generic/tclBasic.c, generic/tclCompCmds.c, generic/tclEnsemble.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h, generic/tclNamesp.c, library/auto.tcl:
	* tests/interp.test, tests/namespace.test, tests/nre.test:
	Converted the [namespace] command into an ensemble. This has the
	consequence of making it vital for Tcl code that wishes to work with
	namespaces to _not_ delete the ::tcl namespace.
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl (loadIntoSlaveInterpreter): Added this
	command to handle connecting tcltest to a slave interpreter. This adds
	in the hook (inside the tcltest namespace) that allows the tests run
	in the child interpreter to be reported as part of the main sequence
	of test results. Bumped version of tcltest to 2.3.3.
	* tests/init.test, tests/package.test: Adapted these test files to use
	the new feature.

	comments, so code better fits the style in the Engineering Manual.

2011-03-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Cleaner mem management for TEBCdata

	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* tests/nre.test: Renamed BottomData to TEBCdata, so that the name

2011-03-01  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	in commented out non-optimised code, left for ref in checkin
	[b97b771b6d]

2011-03-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclResult.c (Tcl_AppendResultVA):	Use the directive

	access, instead of the improvised hack USE_DIRECT_INTERP_RESULT_ACCESS
	from releases past.

2011-03-01  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmdsSZ.c (TclCompileThrowCmd, TclCompileUnsetCmd):
	fix leaks

	trunk compiles.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclNRRunCallbacks): [Patch 3168229]: Don't do

2011-01-18  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOMethod.c (PushMethodCallFrame): [Bug 3001438]: Make
	sure that the cmdPtr field of the procPtr is correct and relevant at
	all times so that [info frame] can report sensible information about a
	frame after a return to it from a recursive call, instead of probably
	crashing (depending on what else has overwritten the Tcl stack!)

	that excess trailing zeroes are suppressed for all eight major code
	paths.

2011-01-12  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c:   Use _vsnprintf in stead of vsnprintf, because

2010-12-30  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (GrowEvaluationStack): Off-by-one error in
	sizing the new allocation - was ok in comment but wrong in the code.
	Triggered by [Bug 3142026] which happened to require exactly one more
	than what was in existence.

2010-12-26  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	which family gets tried first. Cleanup and clarify some of the
	comments.

	belong.

2010-12-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclStrToD.c (SetPrecisionLimits, TclDoubleDigits):

2010-11-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclInt.decls, generic/tclInt.h, generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: TclFormatInt restored at slot 24
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclFormatInt): restore TclFormatInt func from
	2005-07-05 macro-ization. Benchmarks indicate it is faster, as a key
	int->string routine (e.g. int-indexed arrays).

2010-11-29 Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Patch by Miguel, providing a
	[::tcl::unsupported::inject coroname command args], which prepends
	("injects") arbitrary code to a suspended coro's future resumption.
	Neat for debugging complex coros without heavy instrumentation.

	* generic/tclUtil.c:
	* tests/util.test:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc: Rewrite of Tcl_PrintDouble and TclDoubleDigits that
	(a) fixes a severe performance problem with floating point shimmering
	reported by Karl Lehenbauer, (b) allows TclDoubleDigits to generate
	the digit strings for 'e' and 'f' format, so that it can be used for
	tcl_precision != 0 (and possibly later for [format]), (c) fixes [Bug
	3120139] by making TclPrintDouble inherently locale-independent, (d)
	adds test cases to util.test for correct rounding in difficult cases
	of TclDoubleDigits where fixed- precision results are requested. (e)
	adds test cases to util.test for the controversial aspects of [Bug
	3105247]. As a side effect, two more modules from libtommath
	(bn_mp_set_int.c and bn_mp_init_set_int.c) are brought into the build,
	since the new code uses them.

	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclTomMathDecls.h:	Regenerated.

2010-11-24  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/chanio.test, tests/iogt.test, tests/ioTrans.test: Convert more
	tests to tcltest2 and factor them to be easier to understand.

2010-11-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/chanio.test: Converted many tests to tcltest2 by marking the
	setup and cleanup parts as such.

	* tests/main.test: No longer disable tests Tcl_Main-1.4 and 1.6 on
	Windows, because those now work on all supported platforms.
	* win/configure.in:  Set NO_VIZ=1 when zlib is compiled in libtcl,
	this resolves compiler warnings in 64-bit and static builds.
	* win/configure (regenerated)

2010-11-05  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclMain.c: Thanks, Kevin, for the fix, but this how it was
	supposed to be (TCL_ASCII_MAIN is only supposed to be defined on
	WIN32).

2010-11-05  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclMain.c: Added missing conditional on _WIN32 around code
	that messes around with the definition of _UNICODE, to correct a badly
	broken Unix build from Jan's last commit.

2010-11-04  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

2010-11-04  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* tests/socket.test: Run the socket tests three times with the address
	family set to any, inet, and inet6 respectively. Use constraints to
	skip the tests if a family is found to be unsupported or not
	configured on the local machine. Adjust the tests to dynamically adapt
	to the address family that is being tested.

	Rework some of the tests to speed them up by avoiding (supposedly)
	unneeded [after]s.

	* tests/error.test (error-19.13): Another variation on testing for
	issues in [try] compilation.

	* doc/Tcl.n (Variable substitution): [Bug 3099086]: Increase clarity
	of explanation of what characters are actually permitted in variable
	substitutions. Note that this does not constitute a change of
	behavior; it is just an improvement of explanation.

2010-11-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

					     reflected properly to the caller.

2010-11-03  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileCatchCmd): [Bug 3098302]:
	* tests/compile.test (compile-3.6): Reworked the compilation of the
	[catch] command so as to avoid placing any code that might throw an
	exception (specifically, any initial substitutions or any stores to
	result or options variables) between the BEGIN_CATCH and END_CATCH but
	outside the exception range.  Added a test case that panics on a stack
	smash if the change is not made.

	* Changelog.2008: Split off from Changelog.
	* generic/tclIOSock.c (TclCreateSocketAddress): The interp != NULL
	check is needed for ::tcl::unsupported::socketAF as well.

2010-10-26  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c (TcpGetOptionProc): Prevent crash if interp is
	* win/tclWinSock.c (TcpGetOptionProc):   NULL (a legal situation).

2010-10-26  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c (TcpGetOptionProc): Added support for
	::tcl::unsupported::noReverseDNS, which if set to any value, prevents
	[fconfigure -sockname] and [fconfigure -peername] from doing
	reverse DNS queries.

2010-10-24  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[dogeen-assembler-branch]
	* generic/tclAssembly.c:
	* tests/assembly.test (assemble-17.15): Reworked branch handling so
	that forward branches can use jump1 (jumpTrue1, jumpFalse1). Added
	test cases that the forward branches will expand to jump4, jumpTrue4,
	jumpFalse4 when needed.

2010-10-23  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[dogeen-assembler-branch]
	* generic/tclAssembly.h (removed):
				Removed file that was included in only one

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileDictForCmd): Update the compilation
	* generic/tclCompile.c (tclInstructionTable):	of [dict for] so that
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBCresume):		it no longer makes any
	use of INST_DICT_DONE now that's not needed, and make it clearer in
	the implementation of the instruction that it's just a deprecated form
	of unset operation. Followup to my commit of 2010-10-16.

2010-10-19  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c (Tcl_ZlibStreamGet): [Bug 3081008]: Ensure that
	when a bytearray gets its internals entangled with zlib for more than
	a passing moment, that bytearray will never be shimmered away. This
	increases the amount of copying but is simple to get right, which is a
	reasonable trade-off.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_AppendObjToObj): Added some special
	cases so that most of the time when you build up a bytearray by
	appending, it actually ends up being a bytearray rather than
	shimmering back and forth to string.

	* tests/http11.test (check_crc): Use a simpler way to express the
	functionality of this procedure.

	* generic/tclZlib.c: Purge code that wrote to the object returned by
	Tcl_GetObjResult, as we don't want to do that anti-pattern no more.

2010-10-18  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

2010-10-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (ReleaseDictIterator): Factored out the release
	of the bytecode-level dictionary iterator information so that the
	side-conditions on instruction issuing are simpler.

2010-10-15  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/reg_locale.c: [Bug 3085863]: tclUniData 9 years old: Updated
	* generic/tclUniData.c: Unicode tables to latest UnicodeData.txt,
	* tools/uniParse.tcl:   corresponding with Unicode 6.0 (except for
				out-of-range chars > 0xFFFF)

2010-10-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:	Alternative fix for [Bugs 467523,983660] where
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	sharing of empty scripts is allowed again.

2010-10-13  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinThrd.h: (removed) because it is just empty en used nowhere
	* win/tcl.dsp

2010-10-12  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tools/uniClass.tcl:    Spacing and comments: let uniClass.tcl
	* generic/regc_locale.c: generation match better the current
				 (hand-modified) regc_locale.c
	* tools/uniParse.tcl:    Generate proper const qualifiers for
	* generic/tclUniData.c:  tclUniData.c

2010-10-12  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c (CreateClientSocket): [Bug 3084338]: Fix a

	* win/tclWinReg.c:
	* win/tclWinTest.c:   More cleanups
	* win/tclWinFile.c:   Add netapi32 to the link line, so we no longer

2010-10-02  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBCresume): [Bug 3079830]: Added invalidation
	of string representations of dictionaries in some cases.

2010-10-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (EvalStatsCmd): change 'evalstats' to return
	data to interp by default, or if given an arg, use that as filename to
	output to (accepts 'stdout' and 'stderr').  Fix output to print used
	inst count data.
	* generic/tclCkalloc.c: Change TclDumpMemoryInfo sig to allow objPtr
	* generic/tclInt.decls: as well as FILE* as output.
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:

2010-10-01  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c, generic/tclClock.c, generic/tclEncoding.c,

2010-10-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[dogeen-assembler-branch]

	* tests/assemble.test:

	* tests/assemble.test:   Added tryCvtToNumeric and several more list
	* generic/tclAssemble.c: operations.
	* generic/tclAssemble.h:

2010-09-29  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[dogeen-assembler-branch]

	* tests/assemble.test:   Completed conversion of tests to a
	* generic/tclAssemble.c: "white box" structure that follows the
	C code. Added missing safety checks on the operands of 'over' and
	'reverse' so that negative operand counts don't smash the stack.

2010-09-29  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/configure:	Re-generate with autoconf-2.59
	* win/configure:
	* generic/tclMain.c:	Make compilable with -DUNICODE as well

2010-09-28  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	TIP #162 IMPLEMENTATION

	* doc/socket.n:		Document the changes to the [socket] and
				[fconfigure] commands.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Introduce TclCreateSocketAddress() as a
	* generic/tclIOSock.c:	replacement for the platform-dependent
	* unix/tclUnixSock.c:	TclpCreateSocketAddress() functions. Extend
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c:	the [socket] and [fconfigure] commands to
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:	behave as proposed in TIP #162. This is the
	* win/tclWinSock.c:	core of what is required to support the use of
	* win/tclWinPort.h:	IPv6 sockets in Tcl.

	* compat/fake-rfc2553.c: A compat implementation of the APIs defined
	* compat/fake-rfc2553.h: in RFC-2553 (getaddrinfo() and friends) on
				 top of the existing gethostbyname() etc.
	* unix/configure.in:	 Test whether the fake-implementation is
	* unix/tcl.m4:		 needed.
	* unix/Makefile.in:	 Add a compile target for fake-rfc2553.

	* win/configure.in:	Allow cross-compilation by default.

	* tests/socket.test:	Improve the test suite to make more use of
	* tests/remote.tcl:	randomized ports to reduce interference with
				tests running in parallel or other services on
				the machine.

2010-09-28  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[dogeen-assembler-branch]

	* tests/assemble.test: Added more "white box" tests.
	* generic/tclAssembly.c: Added the error checking and reporting
	for undefined labels. Revised code so that no pointers into the
	bytecode sequence are held (because the sequence can move!),
	that no Tcl_HashEntry pointers are held (because the hash table
	doesn't guarantee their stability!) and to eliminate the BBHash
	table, which is merely additional information indexed by jump
	labels and can just as easily be held in the 'label' structure.
	Renamed shared structures to CamelCase, and renamed 'label' to
	JumpLabel because other types of labels may eventually be possible.

2010-09-27  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[dogeen-assembler-branch]

	* tests/assemble.test: Added more "white box" tests.
	* generic/tclAssembly.c: Fixed bugs exposed by the new tests.
	(a) [eval] and [expr] had incorrect stack balance computed if
	the arg was not a simple word. (b) [concat] accepted a negative
	operand count. (c) [invoke] accepted a zero or negative operand
	count. (d) more misspelt error messages.
	Also replaced a funky NRCallTEBC with the new call
	TclNRExecuteByteCode, necessitated by a merge with changes on the
	HEAD.

2010-09-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:    [Patch 3072080] (minus the itcl
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:    update): a saner NRE.
	* generic/tclCompExpr.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.c:  This makes TclNRExecuteByteCode (ex TEBC)
	* generic/tclCompile.h:  to be a normal NRE citizen: it loses its
	* generic/tclExecute.c:  special status.
	* generic/tclInt.decls:  The logic flow within the BC engine is
	* generic/tclInt.h:      simplified considerably.
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c:

	* generic/tclVar.c: Use the macro HasLocalVars everywhere

2010-09-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOMethod.c (ProcedureMethodVarResolver): avoid code
	duplication, let the runtime var resolver call the compiled var
	resolver.

2010-09-26  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[dogeen-assembler-branch]

	* tests/assemble.test:	Added many new tests moving toward a more
	comprehensive test suite for the assembler.
	* generic/tclAssembly.c:	Fixed bugs exposed by the new tests:
	(a) [bitnot] and [not] had incorrect operand counts. (b)
	INST_CONCAT cannot concatenate zero objects. (c) misspelt error
	messages. (d) the "assembly code" internal representation lacked
	a duplicator, which caused double-frees of the Bytecode object
	if assembly code ever was duplicated.

2010-09-25  Kevin B. Kenny   <kennykb@acm.org>

	[dogeen-assembler-branch]

	* generic/tclAssembly.c:	Massive refactoring of the assembler
	* generic/tclAssembly.h:	to use a Tcl-like syntax (and use
	* tests/assemble.test:		Tcl_ParseCommand to parse it). The
	* tests/assemble1.bench:	refactoring also ensures that
	Tcl_Tokens in the assembler have string ranges inside the source
	code, which allows for [eval] and [expr] assembler directives
	that simply call TclCompileScript and TclCompileExpr recursively.

2010-09-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/stringComp.test: improved string eq/cmp test coverage
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): merge INST_STR_CMP and
	INST_STR_EQ/INST_STR_NEQ paths.  Speeds up eq/ne/[string eq] with

	missing.

	* tests/execute.test: Added execute-10.3 for [Bug 3072640]. The test
	causes a mem failure.

	* generic/tclExecute: Protect all possible writes to ::errorInfo or
	::errorCode with DECACHE_STACK_INFO(), as they could run traces. The
	new calls to be protected are Tcl_ResetResult(), Tcl_SetErrorCode(),
	IllegalExprOperandType(), TclExprFloatError(). The error was triggered
	by [Patch 3072080].

2010-09-22  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	resilient against misformatted NAME sections, induced by import of
	Thread package documentation into Tcl doc tree.

	* doc/glob.n: Fixed documentation ambiguity regarding the handling
	of -join.

	* library/safe.tcl (safe::AliasGlob): Fixed another problem, the
	option -join does not stop option processing in the core builtin, so
	the emulation must not do that either.

2010-09-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/safe.tcl (safe::AliasGlob): Moved the command extending the

	* generic/tclExecute.c: traversable accross coro boundaries. Add the

	(NRInterpCoroutine): Replace magic values for formal argument counts
	for coroutine command implementations with #defines, for an increase

2010-04-30  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclMain.c: Unnecessary TCL_STORAGE_CLASS re-definition. It
	was used for an ancient dummy reference to Tcl_LinkVar(), but that's
	already gone since 2002-05-29.

2010-04-29  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

2010-04-29  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* compat/dirent2.h:	Include "tcl.h", not <tcl.h>, like everywhere

2010-04-28  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h (TclIsVarDirectUnsettable): Corrected flags so that
	deletion of traces is not optimized out...

	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExecuteExtendedBinaryMathOp)
	(TclCompareTwoNumbers,ExecuteExtendedUnaryMathOp,TclExecuteByteCode):
	[Patch 2981677]: Move the less common arithmetic operations (i.e.,
	exponentiation and operations on non-longs) out of TEBC for a big drop
	in the overall size of the stack frame for most code. Net effect on
	speed is minimal (slightly faster overall in tclbench). Also extended
	the number of places where TRESULT handling is replaced with a jump to
	dedicated code.

2010-04-27  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	no longer necessary.

2010-04-26  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclLoadDl.c (FindSymbol): [Bug 2992295]: Added an explicit cast

	naturally warning-free.

	* generic/tclStubInit.c:   Add a small amount of gcc-isms (with #ifdef
	* generic/tclOOStubInit.c: guards) to ensure that warnings are issued
	when these files are older than the various *.decls files.

2010-04-25  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

2010-04-15  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinPort.h:       Move inclusion of <tchar.h> from
	* generic/tcl.h:          tclPlatDecls.h to tclWinPort.h, where it
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h: belongs. Add fallback in tcl.h, so TCHAR is
				  available in win32 always.

2010-04-15  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/try.n: [Bug 2987551]: Fix typo.

2010-04-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/platform/pkgIndex.tcl: Check /lib64 for existence of files
	* unix/Makefile.in: matching libc* before accepting it as base
	* win/Makefile.in:  directory. This can happen on weirdly installed
	32bit systems which have an empty or partially filled /lib64 without

2010-04-13  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinPort.h: Fix [Patch 2986105]: conditionally defining

2010-04-08  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmdsSZ.c (TclSubstCompile): If the first token does
	not result in a *guaranteed* push of a Tcl_Obj on the stack, we must
	push an empty object. Otherwise it is possible to get to a 'concat1'

	Thanks to Joe Mistachkin for identifying a script that could trigger

2010-03-24  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOInfo.c (InfoObjectMethodTypeCmd)
	(InfoClassMethodTypeCmd): Added introspection of method types so that

2010-03-22  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	[Bug 2973361]: Compute the correct integer

2010-03-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/exec.n: Make it a bit clearer that there is an option to run a
	pipeline in the background.

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_FcopyObjCmd):		Lift the restriction
	* generic/tclIO.c (TclCopyChannel, CopyData):	on the [fcopy] command
	* generic/tclIO.h (CopyState):			that forced it to only
	copy up to 2GB per script-level callback. Now it is anything that can
	fit in a (signed) 64-bit integer. Problem identified by Frederic
	Bonnet on comp.lang.tcl. Note that individual low-level reads and
	writes are still smaller as the optimal buffer size is smaller.

2010-03-20  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/stub16.c:         Don't hide that we use the ASCII API here.

	of result values.

2010-03-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIORTrans.c (ReflectInput, ReflectOutput)
	(ReflectSeekWide): [Bug 2921116]: Added missing TclEventuallyFree

	* generic/tclOOMethod.c:  Applied missing part of [Patch 2961556]
	* win/tclWinInt.h:	  Change all tclWinProcs signatures to use

				library.

2010-03-05  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclIORTrans.c (ForwardProc): [Bug 2964425]: When cleaning
	the stables, it is sometimes necessary to do more than the minimum. In
	this case, rationalizing the variables for a forwarded limit? method
	required removing an extra Tcl_DecrRefCount too.

	* generic/tclOO.h, generic/tclOOInt.h: [Patch 2961556]: Change TclOO
	to use the same style of function typedefs as Tcl, as this is about
	the last chance to get this right.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	Source code that uses function typedefs from TclOO will need to update
	variables and argument definitions so that pointers to the function
	values are used instead. Binary compatibility is not affected.

	* generic/*.c, generic/tclInt.h, unix/*.c, macosx/*.c: Applied results
	of doing a Code Audit. Principal changes:
	  * Use do { ... } while (0) in macros
	  * Avoid shadowing one local variable with another
	  * Use clearer 'foo.bar++;' instead of '++foo.bar;' where result not
	    required (i.e., semantically equivalent); clarity is increased
	    because it is bar that is incremented, not foo.
	  * Follow Engineering Manual rules on spacing and declarations

2010-03-04  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOO.c (ObjectRenamedTrace): [Bug 2962664]: Add special
	handling so that when the class of classes is deleted, so is the class
	of objects. Immediately.

	* generic/tclOOInt.h (ROOT_CLASS): Add new flag for specially marking
	the root class. Simpler and more robust than the previous technique.

2010-03-04  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclGetDate.y:    3 unnecessary MODULE_SCOPE
	* generic/tclDate.c:       symbols

2010-03-03  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/refchan.n: Followup to ChangeLog entry 2009-10-07
	(generic/tclIORChan.c). Fixed the documentation to explain that errno
	numbers are operating system dependent, and reworked the associated
	example.

2010-03-02  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4:     [FRQ 2959069]: Support for -fvisibility=hidden

2010-03-01  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c: Refrain from a possibly lengthy reverse-DNS
	lookup on 0.0.0.0 when calling [fconfigure -sockname] on an
	universally-bound (default) server socket.

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c: fix [AT 86258]: special-casing of empty
	tables when generating error messages for [::tcl::prefix match].

2010-02-28  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c: More additions of {TCL LOOKUP} error-code
	generation to various subcommands of [info] as part of long-term
	project to classify all Tcl's generated errors.

2010-02-28  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclStubInit.c: [Bug 2959713]: Link error with gcc 4.1

2010-02-27  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (StringFirstCmd, StringLastCmd): [Bug 2960021]:
	Only search for the needle in the haystack when the needle isn't
	larger than the haystack. Prevents an odd crash from sometimes
	happening when things get mixed up (a common programming error).

	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_Main): [Bug 801429]: Factor out the holding
	of the client-installed main loop function into thread-specific data.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	Code that previously tried to set the main loop from another thread
	will now fail. On the other hand, there is a fairly high probability
	that such programs would have been failing before due to the lack of
	any kind of inter-thread memory barriers guarding accesses to this
	part of Tcl's state.

2010-02-26  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:   Split this file into two pieces to make it
	* generic/tclCompCmdsSZ.c: easier to work with. It's still two very
				   long files even after the split.

2010-02-26  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* doc/safe.n: Name the installed file after the command it documents.
	Use "Safe Tcl" instead of the "Safe Base", "Safe Tcl" mixture.

2010-02-26  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in (NATIVE_TCLSH): Added this variable to allow for
	better control of what tclsh to use for various scripts when doing
	cross compiling. An imperfect solution, but works.

	* unix/installManPage: Remap non-alphanumeric sequences in filenames
	to single underscores (especially colons).

2010-02-26  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/zlib.test: Add tests for [Bug 2818131] which was crashing with
	mismatched zlib algorithms used in combination with gets. This issue
	has been fixed by Andreas's last commit.

2010-02-25  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclHash.c:	[FRQ 2958832]: Further speed-up of the
	* generic/tclLiteral.c:	ouster-hash function.
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* generic/tclCkalloc.c:	Eliminate various unnecessary (ClientData)

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (SetDictFromAny): Prevent the list<->dict
	* generic/tclListObj.c (SetListFromAny): conversion code from taking
	too many liberties. Stops loss of duplicate keys in some scenarios.
	Many thanks to Jean-Claude Wippler for finding this.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Reduce ifdef-fery and
	size of activation record. More variables shared across instructions
	than before.

	* doc/socket.n: [Bug 2957688]: Clarified that [socket -server] works
	with a command prefix. Extended example to show this in action.

2010-02-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclZlib.c (ZlibTransformInput): [Bug 2762041]: Added a hack
	to work around the general problem, early EOF recognition based on the
	base-channel, instead of the data we have ready for reading in the
	transform. Long-term we need a proper general fix (likely tracking EOF
	on each level of the channel stack), with attendant complexity.
	Furthermore, Z_BUF_ERROR can be ignored, and must be when feeding the
	zlib code with single characters.

2010-02-22  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:   Remove unnecessary EXTERN's, which already are

2010-02-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringLenCmd): Make [string length]
	of a constant string be handled better (i.e., handle backslashes too).

2010-02-19  Stuart Cassoff  <stwo@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tcl.m4: Correct compiler/linker flags for threaded builds on
	OpenBSD.
	* configure: (regenerated).

2010-02-19  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/installManPage: [Bug 2954638]: Correct behaviour of manual page
	installer. Also added armouring to check that assumptions about the
	initial state are actually valid (e.g., look for existing input file).

2010-02-17  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclHash.c (HashStringKey):	Restore these hash functions
	* generic/tclLiteral.c (HashString):	to use the classic algorithm.
	* generic/tclObj.c (TclHashObjKey):	Community felt normal case
	speed to be more important than resistance to malicious cases. For
	now, hashes that need to deal with the malicious case can use a custom
	hash table and install their own hash function, though that is not
	functionality exposed to the script level.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileDictUpdateCmd): Stack depth must be
	correctly described when compiling a body to prevent crashes in some
	debugging modes.

2010-02-16  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: Change order of various struct members,
	fixing potential binary incompatibility with Tcl 8.5

2010-02-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/configure.in, generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_Stat): Updated so that
	we do not assume that all unix systems have the POSIX blkcnt_t type,
	since OpenBSD apparently does not.

	* generic/tclLiteral.c (HashString): Missed updating to FNV in one
	place; the literal table (a copy of the hash table code...)

2010-02-15  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:   Reverted earlier rename from tcl*Stubs to
	* generic/tclBasic.c:   tcl*ConstStubs, it's not necessary at all.
	* generic/tclOO.c:
	* generic/tclTomMathInterface.c:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: (regenerated)
	* generic/tclOOStubInit.c: (regenerated)

	* win/tclWinInt.h:      make tclWinProcs "const"
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:     Eliminate all internal Tcl_WinUtfToTChar
	* win/tclWinFile.c:     and Tcl_WinTCharToUtf calls, needed

	* compat/unicows/license.txt: support.
	* compat/unicows/unicows.lib:

2010-02-15  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOO.c (AllocObject, SquelchedNsFirst, ObjectRenamedTrace):
	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_DeleteNamespace): [Bug 2950259]: Revised
	the namespace deletion code to provide an additional internal callback
	that gets triggered early enough in namespace deletion to allow TclOO
	destructors to run sanely. Adjusted TclOO to take advantage of this,
	so making tearing down an object by killing its namespace appear to
	work seamlessly, which is needed for Itcl. (Note that this is not a
	feature that will ever be backported to 8.5, and it remains not a
	recommended way of deleting an object.)

2010-02-13  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSwitchCmd): Divided the [switch]
	compiler into three pieces (after the model of [try]): a parser, an
	instruction-issuer for chained tests, and an instruction-issuer for
	jump tables.

	* generic/tclEnsemble.c: Split the ensemble engine out into its own
	file rather than keeping it mashed together with the namespace code.

2010-02-12  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tcl.m4:		Use -pipe for gcc on win32
	* win/configure:	(mingw/cygwin) (regenerated)
	* win/.cvsignore:	Add .lib, .exp and .res here

2010-02-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/list.test: Add tests for explicit \0 in a string argument to
	the list command.

2010-02-11  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_OpenObjCmd): [Bug 2949740]: Make sure that
	we do not try to put a NULL pipeline channel into binary mode.

2010-02-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	[Bug 2826551, Patch 2948425]: Assorted regexp bugs related to -all,
	-line and -start options and newlines.
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegexpObjCmd): If -offset is given, treat it
	as the start of the line if the previous character was a newline. Fix
	nasty edge case where a zero length match would not advance the index.
	* tests/regexp.test: Add regression tests back ported from Jacl.
	Checks for a number of issues related to -line and newline handling. A
	few of tests were broken before the patch and continue to be broken,
	marked as knownBug.

2010-02-11  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOO.c (ObjectRenamedTrace): [Bug 2949397]: Prevent
	destructors from running on the two core class objects when the whole
	interpreter is being destroyed.

2010-02-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileTryCmd, IssueTryInstructions)
	(IssueTryFinallyInstructions): Added compiler for the [try] command.
	It is split into three pieces that handle the parsing of the tokens,
	the issuing of instructions for finally-free [try], and the issuing of
	instructions for [try] with finally; there are enough differences
	between the all cases that it was easier to split the code rather than
	have a single function do the whole thing.

2010-02-09  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Remove dependency on 8.5+ idiom "in" in
	expressions.

2010-02-08  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c (Tcl_ZlibDeflate, Tcl_ZlibInflate): [Bug 2947783]:
	Make sure that the result is an unshared object before appending to it
	so that nothing crashes if it is shared (use in Tcl code was not
	affected by this, but use from C was an issue).

2010-02-06  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclHash.c (HashStringKey):	Replace Tcl's crusty old hash
	* generic/tclObj.c (TclHashObjKey):	function with the algorithm
	due to Fowler, Noll and Vo. This is slightly faster (assuming the
	presence of hardware multiply) and has somewhat better distribution
	properties of the resulting hash values. Note that we only ever used
	the 32-bit version of the FNV algorithm; Tcl's core hash engine
	assumes that hash values are simple unsigned ints.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	Code that depends on hash iteration order (especially tests) may well
	be disrupted by this. Where a definite order is required, the fix is
	usually to just sort the results after extracting them from the hash.
	Where this is insufficient, the code that has ceased working was
	always wrong and was only working by chance.

2010-02-05  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileErrorCmd): Added compilation of the
	[error] command. No new bytecodes.

2010-02-05  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:	Follow-up to earlier commit today:
	          Eliminate the need for an extra Stubs Pointer for adressing
	          a static stub table: Just change the exported table from
	          static to MODULE_SCOPE.
	* generic/tclBasic.c
	* generic/tclOO.c
	* generic/tclTomMathInterface.c
	* generic/tcl*Decls.h (regenerated)
	* generic/tclStubInit.c (regenerated)
	* generic/tclOOStubInit.c (regenerated)
	* generic/tclTest.c (minor formatting)

2010-02-05  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: More consistency in errorcode generation.

	* generic/tclOOBasic.c (TclOO_Object_Destroy): Rewrote to be NRE-aware
	when calling destructors. Note that there is no guarantee that
	destructors will always be called in an NRE context; that's a feature
	of the 'destroy' method only.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c: Add 'const' to many function-internal vars
	that are never pointing to things that are written to.

2010-02-05  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:	Follow-up to [2010-01-29] commit:
		prevent space within stub table function parameters if the
		parameter type is a pointer.
	* win/tclWinInt.h:	Minor Formatting
	* generic/tcl.h:	VOID -> void and other formatting
	* generic/tclInt.h:	Minor formatting
	* generic/tclInt.decls: Change signature of TclNRInterpProcCore,
	* generic/tclOO.decls:	and TclOONewProc(Instance|)MethodEx,
	* generic/tclProc.c:	indicating that errorProc is a function,
	* generic/tclOOMethod.c:pointer, and other formatting
	* generic/tcl*Decls.h:	(regenerated)
	* generic/tclVar.c:	gcc warning(line 3703): 'pattern' may be used
				uninitialized in this function
				gcc warning(line 3788): 'matched' may be used
				uninitialized in this function

2010-02-04  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: Added more use of error-codes and reduced the
	stack overhead of older interfaces.
	(ArrayGetCmd): Stop silly crash when using a trivial pattern due to
	error in conversion to ensemble.
	(ArrayNamesCmd): Use the object RE interface for faster matching.

2010-02-03  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (ArrayUnsetCmd): More corrections.

2010-02-02  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: Turned the [array] command into a true ensemble.

	* generic/tclOO.c (AllocObject, MyDeleted): A slightly faster way to
	handle the deletion of [my] is with a standard delete callback. This
	is because it doesn't require an additional memory allocation during
	object creation. Also reduced the amount of string manipulation
	performed during object creation to further streamline memory
	handling; this is not backported to the 8.5 package as it breaks a
	number of abstractions.

	* generic/tclOOBasic.c (TclOO_Object_Destroy): [Bug 2944404]: Do not
	crash when a destructor deletes the object that is executing that
	destructor.

2010-02-01  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_ArrayObjCmd): [Bug 2939073]: Stop the [array
	unset] command from having dangling pointer problems when an unset
	trace deletes the element that is going to be processed next. Many
	thanks to Alexandre Ferrieux for the bulk of this fix.

	* generic/regexec.c (ccondissect, crevdissect): [Bug 2942697]: Rework
	these functions so that certain pathological patterns are matched much
	more rapidly. Many thanks to Tom Lane for dianosing this issue and
	providing an initial patch.

2010-01-30  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (tclInstructionTable):	Bytecode instructions
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileUnsetCmd):	to allow the [unset]
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode):	command to be compiled
	with the compiler being a complete compilation for all compile-time
	decidable uses.

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclPtrUnsetVar): Var reference version of the code
	to unset a variable. Required for INST_UNSET bytecodes.

2010-01-29  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: [Bug 2942081]: Reverted Tcl_ThreadDataKey type change
				Changed some Tcl_CallFrame fields from "char *"
				to "void *". This saves unnecessary space on
				Cray's (and it's simply more correct).

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:	No longer generate a space after "*" and
				immediately after a function name, so the
				format of function definitions in tcl*Decls.h
				match all other tcl*.h header files.
	* doc/ParseArgs.3:	Change Tcl_ArgvFuncProc, Tcl_ArgvGenFuncProc
	* generic/tcl.h:	and GetFrameInfoValueProc to be function
	* generic/tclInt.h:	definitions, not pointers, for consistency
	* generic/tclOOInt.h:	with all other Tcl function definitions.
	* generic/tclIndexObj.c:
	* generic/regguts.h:	CONST -> const
	* generic/tcl.decls:	Formatting
	* generic/tclTomMath.decls: Formatting
	* generic/tclDecls.h:	(regenerated)
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclOODecls.h:

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclTomMathDecls.h:

2010-01-28  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOBasic.c (TclOO_Object_Destroy): Move the execution of
	destructors to a point where they can produce an error. This will not
	work for all destructors, but it does mean that more failing calls of
	them will be caught.
	* generic/tclOO.c (AllocObject, MyDeletedTrace, ObjectRenamedTrace):
	(ObjectNamespaceDeleted): Stop various ways of getting at commands
	with dangling pointers to the object. Also increases the reliability
	of calling of destructors (though most destructors won't benefit; when
	an object is deleted namespace-first, its destructors are not run in a
	nice state as the namespace is partially gone).

2010-01-25  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOStubInit.c:   Remove double includes (which causes a
	* generic/tclOOStubLib.c:    warning in CYGWIN compiles)
	* unix/.cvsignore:	     add confdefs.h

2010-01-22  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/proc.n: [Bug 1970629]: Define a bit better what the current
	namespace of a procedure is.

2010-01-22  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:	     Don't use DWORD and HANDLE here.
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tcl.h:	     Revert [2009-12-21] change, instead
	* generic/tclPort.h:	     resolve the CYGWIN inclusion problems by

				     places.
	* win/tclWinError.c
	* win/tclWinPipe.c
	* win/tcl.m4:		     Make cygwin configuration error into
	* win/configure.in:	     a warning: CYGWIN compilation works
	* win/configure:	     although there still are test failures.

2010-01-22  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Improve error code
	generation from some of the tailcall-related bits of TEBC.

	update] are doing with variables.

2010-01-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CreateScriptRecord): [Bug 2918110]: Initialize
	the EventScriptRecord (esPtr) fully before handing it to
	Tcl_CreateChannelHandler for registration. Otherwise a reflected
	channel calling 'chan postevent' (== Tcl_NotifyChannel) in its
	'watchProc' will cause the function 'TclChannelEventScriptInvoker'
	to be run on an uninitialized structure.

2010-01-18  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_AppendFormatToObj): [Bug 2932421]: Stop
	the [format] command from causing argument objects to change their
	internal representation when not needed. Thanks to Alexandre Ferrieux
	for this fix.

2010-01-13  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl:	  More factoring out of special cases
	* tools/tcltk-man2html-utils.tcl: so that they are described outside
	the engine file. Now there is only one real set of special cases in
	there, to handle the .SO/.OP/.SE directives.

2010-01-12  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: Make the generation of the list of things
	to process the docs from simpler and more flexible. Also factored out
	the lists of special cases.

2010-01-10  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

2010-01-10  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/namespace.test (namespace-51.17): [Bug 2898722]: Demonstrate
	that there are still bugs in the handling of resolution epochs. This
	bug is not yet fixed.

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl:	  Split the man->html converter into
	* tools/tcltk-man2html-utils.tcl: two pieces for easier maintenance.
	Also made it much less verbose in its printed messages by default.

2010-01-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: Added basic support for building the docs
	for contributed packages into the HTML versions. Prompted by question
	on Tcler's Chat by Tom Krehbiel. Note that there remain problems in
	the documentation generated due to errors in the contributed docs.

2010-01-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c (TclPathPart):   [Bug 2918610]: Correct

2009-12-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	[Bug 2917627]: Fix for bad cmd resolution by
	* tests/coroutine.test:	coroutines. Thanks to schelte for finding it.

2009-12-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* library/safe.tcl (::safe::AliasGlob): Upgrade to correctly support a
	larger fraction of [glob] functionality, while being stricter about
	directory management.

2009-12-11  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c:	Fix gcc warning: ignoring return value of
	* unix/tclUnixNotify.c:	"write", declared with attribute
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c:	warn_unused_result.
	* generic/tclInt.decls:	CONSTify functions TclpGetUserHome and

	* generic/tclInterp.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:

2009-12-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/tm.n: [Bug 1911342]: Formatting rewrite to avoid bogus crosslink
	to the list manpage when generating HTML.

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl (Init): [Bug 2913616]: Do not use platform
	tests that are not needed and which don't work in safe interpreters.

2009-12-14  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/file.n (file tempfile): [Bug 2388866]: Note that this only ever
	creates files on the native filesystem. This is a design feature.

2009-12-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Release TclPopCallFrame() from its
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	tailcall-management duties
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Moving TclBCArgumentRelease call from
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	TclNRTailcallObjCmd to TEBC, so that the
	pairing of the Enter and Release calls is clearer.

2009-12-12  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestconcatobjCmd): [Bug 2895367]: Stop memory
	leak when testing. We don't need extra noise of this sort when
	tracking down real problems!

2009-12-11  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBinary.c:	Fix gcc warning, using gcc-4.3.4 on cygwin
	* generic/tclCompExpr.c:warning: array subscript has type 'char'
	* generic/tclPkg.c:
	* libtommath/bn_mp_read_radix.c:
	* win/makefile.vc:	[Bug 2912773]: Revert to version 1.203
	* unix/tclUnixCompat.c:	Fix gcc warning: signed and unsigned type
				in conditional expression.

2009-12-11  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl (long-toc, cross-reference): [FRQ 2897296]:
	Added cross links to sections within manual pages.

2009-12-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:   [Bug 2806407]: Full nre-enabling of coroutines
	* generic/tclExecute.c:

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Small cleanup

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Fix panic in http11.test caused by buggy
	earlier commits in coroutine management.

2009-12-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclObj.c (TclContinuationsEnter): [Bug 2895323]: Updated
	comments to describe when the function can be entered for the same
	Tcl_Obj* multiple times. This is a continuation of the 2009-11-10
	entry where a memory leak was plugged, but where not sure if that was
	just a band-aid to paper over some other error. It isn't, this is a
	legal situation.

2009-12-10  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:   Reducing the # of moving parts for coroutines
	* generic/tclExecute.c: by delegating more to tebc; eliminate the
	special coroutine CallFrame.

2009-12-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c: [Bug 2901998]: Applied Alexandre Ferrieux's patch
	fixing the inconsistent buffered I/O. Tcl's I/O now flushes buffered
	output before reading, discards buffered input before writing, etc.

2009-12-09  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Ensure right lifetime of varFrame's (objc,objv)
	for coroutines.

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Code regrouping

2009-12-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Added some of the missing setting of errorcode
	values.

2009-12-08  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclStackFree): Improved panic msg.

2009-12-08  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:   Partial nre-enabling of coroutines. The
	* generic/tclExecute.c: initial call still requires its own
	* generic/tclInt.h:     instance of tebc, but on resume coros can
	execute in the caller's tebc.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC): Silence warning about pcAdjustment.

2009-12-08  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Make the dict opcodes
	more sparing in their use of C variables, to reduce size of TEBC
	activiation record a little bit.

2009-12-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC): Grouping "slow" variables into structs,
	to reduce register pressure and help the compiler with variable
	allocation.

2009-12-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Start cleaning the TEBC stables
	* generic/tclInt.h:

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:   [Bug 2910094]: Fix by aku
	* tests/coroutine.test:

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Arrange for [tailcall] to be created with the
	other builtins: was being created in a separate call, leftover from
	pre-tip days.

2009-12-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStrToD.c: [Bug 2902010]: Correct conditional compile
	directives to better detect the toolchain that needs extra work for
	proper underflow treatment instead of merely detecting the MIPS
	platform.

2009-12-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: [Patch 2910056]: Add ::tcl::unsupported::yieldTo
	* generic/tclInt.h:

2009-12-07  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TryPostBody): [Bug 2910044]: Close off memory
	leak in [try] when a variable-free handler clause is present.

2009-12-05  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:   Small changes for clarity in tailcall
	* generic/tclExecute.c: and coroutine code.
	* tests/coroutine.test:

	* tests/tailcall.test: Remove some old unused crud; improved the
	stack depth tests.

	* generic/tclBasic.c:  Fixed things so that you can tailcall
	* generic/tclNamesp.c: properly out of a coroutine.
	* tests/tailcall.test:

	* generic/tclInterp.c: Fixed tailcalls for same-interp aliases (no
	test)

2009-12-03  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* library/safe.tcl (::safe::AliasEncoding): Make the safe encoding
	command behave more closely like the unsafe one (for safe ops).
	(::safe::AliasGlob): [Bug 2906841]: Clamp down on evil use of [glob]
	in safe interpreters.
	* tests/safe.test: Rewrite to use tcltest2 better.

2009-12-02  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:	Add support for win32 CALLBACK functions and
	remove obsolete "emitStubs" and "genStubs" functions.
	* win/Makefile.in:	Use tcltest86.dll for all tests, and add
	.PHONY rules to preemptively stop trouble that plagued Tk from hitting
	Tcl too.

2009-11-30  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:	Don't use EXPORT for Tcl_InitStubs
	* win/Makefile.in:	Better dependancies in case of static build.

2009-11-30  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/Tcl.n: [Bug 2901433]: Improved description of expansion to
	mention that it is using list syntax.

2009-11-27  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclAppInit.c (Tcl_AppInit): [Bug 2902965]: Reverted Jan's change
	that added a call to Tcl_InitStubs. The 'tclsh' and 'tcltest' programs
	are providers, not consumers of the Stubs table, and should not link
	with the Stubs library, but only with the main Tcl library. (In any
	case, the presence of Tcl_InitStubs broke the build.)

2009-11-27  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/BoolObj.3, doc/Class.3, doc/CrtChannel.3, doc/DictObj.3:
	* doc/DoubleObj.3, doc/Ensemble.3, doc/Environment.3:
	* doc/FileSystem.3, doc/Hash.3, doc/IntObj.3, doc/Limit.3:
	* doc/Method.3, doc/NRE.3, doc/ObjectType.3, doc/PkgRequire.3:
	* doc/SetChanErr.3, doc/SetResult.3: [Patch 2903921]: Many small
	spelling fixes from Larry Virden.

	BUMP VERSION OF TCLOO TO 0.6.2. Too many people need accumulated small
	versions and bugfixes, so the version-bump removes confusion.

	* generic/tclOOBasic.c (TclOO_Object_LinkVar): [Bug 2903811]: Remove
	unneeded restrictions on who can usefully call this method.

2009-11-26  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add .PHONY rules and documentation to preemptively
	stop trouble that plagued Tk from hitting Tcl too, and to make the
	overall makefile easier to understand. Some reorganization too to move
	related rules closer together.

2009-11-26  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/Makefile.in:	[Bug 2902965]: Fix stub related changes that
	* win/makefile.vc:	caused tclkit build to break.
	* win/tclAppInit.c
	* unix/tcl.m4
	* unix/Makefile.in
	* unix/tclAppInit.c
	* unix/configure:	(regenerated)

2009-11-25  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/Makefile.in:	Added a 'test-tcl' rule that is identical to
	'test' except that it does not go spelunking in 'pkgs/'. (This rule
	has existed in unix/Makefile.in for some time.)

2009-11-25  Stuart Cassoff  <stwo@users.sf.net>

	* unix/configure.in:	[Patch 2892871]: Remove unneeded
	* unix/tcl.m4:		AC_STRUCT_TIMEZONE and use
	* unix/tclConfig.h.in:	AC_CHECK_MEMBERS([struct stat.st_blksize])
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:	instead of AC_STRUCT_ST_BLKSIZE.
	* unix/configure:	Regenerated with autoconf-2.59.

2009-11-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/tclIndex: Manually redone the part of tclIndex dealing with
	safe.tcl and tm.tcl. This part passes the testsuite. Note that
	automatic regeneration of this part is not possible because it wrongly
	puts 'safe::Setup' on the list, and wrongly leaves out 'safe::Log'
	which is more dynamically created than the generator expects.

	Further note that the file "clock.tcl" is explicitly loaded by
	"init.tcl", the first time the clock command is invoked. The relevant
	code can be found at line 172ff, roughly, the definition of the
	procedure 'clock'. This means none of the procedures of this file
	belong in the tclIndex. Another indicator that automatic regeneration
	of tclIndex is ill-advised.

2009-11-24  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOO.c (FinalizeAlloc, Tcl_NewObjectInstance):
	[Bug 2903011]: Make it an error to destroy an object in a constructor,
	and also make sure that an object is not deleted twice in the error
	case.

2009-11-24  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fCmd.test: [Bug 2893771]: Teach [file stat] to handle locked
	* win/tclWinFile.c: files so that [file exists] no longer lies.

2009-11-23  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/fCmd.test (fCmd-30.1): Changed registry location of the 'My
	Documents' folder to the one that's correct for Windows 2000, XP,
	Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, and Windows 7. (See
	http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310746)

2009-11-23  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c:	#undef STATIC_BUILD, in order to make sure
	* win/tclWinReg.c:	that Xxxxx_Init is always exported even when
	* generic/tclTest.c:	Tcl is built static (otherwise we cannot
				create a DLL).
	* generic/tclThreadTest.c: Make all functions static, except
				TclThread_Init.
	* tests/fCmd.test:	Enable fCmd-30.1 when registry is available.
	* win/tcl.m4:		Fix ${SHLIB_LD_LIBS} definition, fix conflicts
	* win/Makefile.in:	Simplifications related to tcl.m4 changes.
	* win/configure.in:	Between static libraries and import library on
				windows.
	* win/configure:	(regenerated)
	* win/makefile.vc:	Add stub library to necessary link lines.

2009-11-23  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c (NewTestThread): [Bug 2901803]: Further
	machinations to get NewTestThread actually to launch the thread, not
	just compile.

2009-11-22  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c (NewTestThread): [Bug 2901803]: Fix small
	error in function naming which blocked a threaded test build.

2009-11-19  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/Makefile.in:	Create tcltest86.dll as dynamic Tcltest
				package.
	* generic/tclTest.c:	Remove extraneous prototypes, follow-up to
	* generic/tclTestObj.c:	[Bug 2883850]
	* tests/chanio.test:	Test-cases for fixed [Bug 2849797]
	* tests/io.test:
	* tests/safe.test:	Fix safe-10.1 and safe-10.4 test cases, making
				the wrong assumption that Tcltest is a static
				package.
	* generic/tclEncoding.c:[Bug 2857044]: Updated freeIntRepProc routines
	* generic/tclVar.c:	so that they set the typePtr field to NULL so
				that the Tcl_Obj is not left in an
				inconsistent state.
	* unix/tcl.m4:		[Patch 2883533]: tcl.m4 support for Haiku OS
	* unix/configure:	autoconf-2.59

2009-11-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclAppInit.c:	[Bug 2883850, 2900542]: Repair broken build of

	* library/auto.tcl (tcl_findLibrary):
	* library/clock.tcl (MakeUniquePrefixRegexp, MakeParseCodeFromFields)
	(SetupTimeZone, ProcessPosixTimeZone):	Restored the use of a literal
	* library/history.tcl (HistAdd):	'then' when following a multi-
	* library/safe.tcl (interpConfigure):	line test expresssion. It's an
	* library/tm.tcl (UnknownHandler):	aid to readability then.

2009-11-19  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

2009-11-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TtyParseMode): Partial undo of Donal's tidy-up
	from a few days ago (2009-11-9, not in ChangeLog). It seems that
	strchr is apparently a macro on AIX and reacts badly to pre-processor
	directives in its arguments.

2009-11-16  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c:  [Bug 2891556]: Fix and improve test to
	* generic/tclTest.c:	  detect similar manifestations in the future.
	* tests/encoding.test:    Add tcltest support for finalization.

2009-11-15  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c: Avoid gcc compiler warning by explicitly casting
	DdeCreateStringHandle argument.

2009-11-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CopyData): [Bug 2895565]: Dropped bogosity which
	* tests/io.test: used the number of _written_ bytes or character to
	update the counters for the read bytes/characters. New test io-53.11.
	This is a forward port from the 8.5 branch.

2009-11-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclClock.c (TclClockInit):    Do not create [clock] support
	commands in safe interps.

2009-11-11  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::geturl): [Bug 2891171]: URL checking
	too strict when using multiple question marks.

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:

2009-11-11  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c: Fix [Bug 2888099] (close discards ENOSPC error) by
	saving the errno from the first of two FlushChannel()s. Uneasy to
	test; might need specific channel drivers. Four-hands with aku.

2009-11-10  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winFCmd.test: Cleanup directories that have been set chmod
	000. On Windows7 and Vista we really have no access and these were
	getting left behind.
	A few tests were changed to reflect the intent of the test where
	setting a directory chmod 000 should prevent any modification. This
	restriction was ignored on XP but is honoured on Vista

2009-11-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Plug another leak in TCL_EVAL_DIRECT evaluation.
	Forward port from Tcl 8.5 branch, change by Don Porter.

	* generic/tclObj.c: [Bug 2895323]: Plug memory leak in
	TclContinuationsEnter(). Forward port from Tcl 8.5 branch, change by
	Don Porter.

2009-11-09  Stuart Cassoff  <stwo@users.sf.net>

	* win/README: [bug 2459744]: Removed outdated Msys + Mingw info.

2009-11-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclEvalObjEx): Moved the #280 decrement of
	refCount for the file path out of the branch after the whole
	conditional, closing a memory leak. Added clause on structure type to
	prevent seg.faulting. Forward port from valgrinding the Tcl 8.5
	branch.

	* tests/info.test: Resolve ambiguous resolution of variable "res".
	Forward port from 8.5

2009-11-08  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/string.n (bytelength): Noted that this command is not a good
	thing to use, and suggested a better alternatve. Also factored out the
	description of the indices into its own section.

2009-11-07  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fCmd.test: [Bug 2891026]: Exclude tests using chmod 555
	directories on vista and win7. The current user has access denied and
	so cannot rename the directory without admin privileges.

2009-11-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/safe.tcl (::safe::Setup): Added documentation of the
	contents of the state array. Also killed the 'InterpState' procedure
	with its upleveled variable/upvar combination, and replaced all uses
	with 'namespace upvar'.

2009-11-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/safe.tcl: A series of patches which bring the SafeBase up to
	date with code guidelines, Tcl's features, also eliminating a number
	of inefficiencies along the way.
	(1) Changed all procedure names to be fully qualified.
	(2) Moved the procedures out of the namespace eval. Kept their
	locations. IOW, broke the namespace eval apart into small sections not
	covering the procedure definitions.
	(3) Reindented the code. Just lots of whitespace changes.
	Functionality unchanged.
	(4) Moved the multiple namespace eval's around. Command export at the
	top, everything else (var decls, argument parsing setup) at the
	bottom.
	(5) Moved the argument parsing setup into a procedure called when the
	code is loaded. Easier management of temporary data.
	(6) Replaced several uses of 'Set' with calls to the new procedure
	'InterpState' and direct access to the per-slave state array.
	(7) Replaced the remaining uses of 'Set' and others outside of the
	path/token handling, and deleted a number of procedures related to
	state array access which are not used any longer.
	(8) Converted the path token system to cache normalized paths and path
	<-> token conversions. Removed more procedures not used any longer.
	Removed the test cases 4.3 and 4.4 from safe.test. They were testing
	the now deleted command "InterpStateName".
	(9) Changed the log command setup so that logging is compiled out
	completely when disabled (default).
	(10) Misc. cleanup. Inlined IsInterp into CheckInterp, its only user.
	Consistent 'return -code error' for error reporting. Updated to use
	modern features (lassign, in/ni, dicts). The latter are used to keep a
	reverse path -> token map and quicker check of existence.
	(11) Fixed [Bug 2854929]: Recurse into all subdirs under all TM root
	dirs and put them on the access path.

2009-11-02  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/tzdata/Asia/Novokuznetsk: New tzdata locale for Kemerovo
	oblast', which now keeps Novosibirsk time and not Kranoyarsk time.
	* library/tzdata/Asia/Damascus: Syrian DST changes.
	* library/tzdata/Asia/Hong_Kong: Hong Kong historic DST corrections.
	Olson tzdata2009q.

2009-11-02  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/object.n (DESCRIPTION): Substantive revision to make it clearer
	what the fundamental semantics of an object actually are.

2009-11-01  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* doc/Cancel.3: Minor cosmetic fixes.
	* win/makefile.vc: Make htmlhelp target work again.  An extra set of
	double quotes around the definition of the HTML help compiler tool
	appears to be required.  Previously, there was one set of double
	quotes around the definition of the tool and one around the actual
	invocation.  This led to confusion because it was the only such tool
	path to include double quotes around its invocation.  Also, it was
	somewhat inflexible in the event that somebody needed to override the
	tool command to include arguments.  Therefore, even though it may look
	"wrong", there are now two double quotes on either side of the tool
	path definition.  This fixes the problem that currently prevents the
	htmlhelp target from building and maintains flexibility in case
	somebody needs to override it via the command line or an environment
	variable.

2009-11-01  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Eval.3, doc/Cancel.3: Move TIP#285 routines out of Eval.3 into
	their own manpage.

2009-10-31  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (ExprRoundFunc): [Bug 2889593]: Correctly report
	the expected number of arguments when generating an error for round().

2009-10-30  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test: When creating the notwritabledir we deny the
	current user access to delete the file. We must grant this right when
	we cleanup. Required on Windows 7 when the user does not automatically
	have administrator rights.

2009-10-29  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:        Changed the typedef for the mp_digit type
	from:
		typedef unsigned long mp_digit;
	to:
		typedef unsigned int mp_digit;
	For 32-bit builds where "long" and "int" are two names for the same
	thing, this is no change at all.  For 64-bit builds, though, this
	causes the dp[] array of an mp_int to be made up of 32-bit elements
	instead of 64-bit elements.  This is a huge improvement because
	details elsewhere in the mp_int implementation cause only 28 bits of
	each element to be actually used storing number data.  Without this
	change bignums are over 50% wasted space on 64-bit systems.  [Bug
	2800740].

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	For 64-bit builds, callers of routines with (mp_digit) or (mp_digit *)
	arguments *will*, and callers of routines with (mp_int *) arguments
	*may* suffer both binary and stubs incompatibilities with Tcl releases
	8.5.0 - 8.5.7.  Such possibilities should be checked, and if such
	incompatibilities are present, suitable [package require] requirements
	on the Tcl release should be put in place to keep such built code
	[load]-ing only in Tcl interps that are compatible.

2009-10-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/dict.test: Make variable-clean and simplify tests by utilizing
	the fact that dictionaries have defined orders.

	* generic/tclZlib.c (TclZlibCmd): Remove accidental C99-ism which
	reportedly makes the AIX native compiler choke.

2009-10-29  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl (LocalizeFormat):
	* tests/clock.test (clock-67.1):
	[Bug 2819334]: Corrected a problem where '%%' followed by a letter in
	a format group could expand recursively: %%R would turn into %%H:%M:%S

2009-10-28  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclLiteral.c:	[Bug 2888044]: Fixed 2 bugs.
	* tests/info.test:	First, as noted in the comments of the
	TclCleanupLiteralTable routine, since the teardown of the intrep of
	one Tcl_Obj can cause the teardown of others in the same table, the
	full table cleanup must be done with care, but the code did not
	contain the same care demanded in the comment.  Second, recent
	additions to the info.test file had poor hygiene, leaving an array
	variable ::a lying around, which breaks later interp.test tests during
	a -singleproc 1 run of the test suite.

2009-10-28  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/fileName.test (fileName-20.[78]): Corrected poor test
	hygiene (failure to save and restore the working directory) that
	caused these two tests to fail on Windows (and [Bug 2806250] to be
	reopened).

2009-10-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: [Bug 2884203]: Missing refcount on cached
	normalized path caused crashes.

2009-10-27  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl (ParseClockScanFormat): [Bug 2886852]: Corrected a
	problem where [clock scan] didn't load the timezone soon enough when
	processing a time format that lacked a complete date.
	* tests/clock.test (clock-66.1):
	Added a test case for the above bug.
	* library/tzdata/America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires:
	* library/tzdata/America/Argentina/Cordoba:
	* library/tzdata/America/Argentina/San_Luis:

2009-10-26  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:	Remove $(PACKAGE).* and prototype from the
	`make distclean` target.  Completes 2009-10-20 commit.

2009-10-24  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl (ProcessPosixTimeZone):
	Corrected a regression in the fix to [Bug 2207436] that caused
	[clock] to apply EU daylight saving time rules in the US.
	Thanks to Karl Lehenbauer for reporting this regression.
	* tests/clock.test (clock-52.4):
	Added a regression test for the above bug.
	* library/tzdata/Asia/Dhaka:
	* library/tzdata/Asia/Karachi:
	New DST rules for Bangladesh and Pakistan. (Olson's tzdata2009o.)

2009-10-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (FlushChannel): Skip OutputProc for low-level
	0-length writes. When closing pipes which have already been closed
	not skipping leads to spurious SIG_PIPE signals. Reported by
	Mikhail Teterin <mi+thun@aldan.algebra.com>.

2009-10-22  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOOBasic.c (TclOO_Object_VarName): [Bug 2883857]: Allow
	the passing of array element names through this method.

2009-10-21  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclPosixStr.c: [Bug 2882561]: Work around oddity on Haiku OS
	where SIGSEGV and SIGBUS are the same value.

	* generic/tclTrace.c (StringTraceProc): [Bug 2881259]: Added back cast
	to work around silly bug in MSVC's handling of auto-casting.

2009-10-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:	Removed the long outdated and broken targets
	package-* that were for building Solaris packages.  Appears that the
	pieces needed for these targets to function have never been present in
	the current era of Tcl development and belong completely to Tcl
	pre-history.

2009-10-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c:      [Patch 2107634]: Revised ReadChars and
	FilterInputBytes routines to permit reads to continue up to the string
	limits of Tcl values.  Before revisions, large read attempts could
	panic when as little as half the limiting value length was reached.
	Thanks to Sean Morrison and Bob Parker for their roles in the fix.

2009-10-18  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* generic/tclObj.c (TclDbDumpActiveObjects, TclDbInitNewObj)
	(Tcl_DbIncrRefCount, Tcl_DbDecrRefCount, Tcl_DbIsShared):
	[Bug 2871908]: Enforce separation of concerns between the lineCLPtr
	and objThreadMap thread specific data members.

2009-10-18  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* tests/thread.test (thread-4.[345]): [Bug 1565466]: Correct tests to
	save their error state before the final call to threadReap just in
	case it triggers an "invalid thread id" error.  This error can occur
	if one or more of the target threads has exited prior to the attempt
	to send it an asynchronous exit command.

2009-10-17  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (UnsetVarStruct, TclDeleteNamespaceVars)
	(TclDeleteCompiledLocalVars, DeleteArray):
	* generic/tclTrace.c (Tcl_UntraceVar2): [Bug 2629338]: Stop traces
	that are deleted part way through (a feature used by tdom) from
	causing freed memory to be accessed.

2009-10-08  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictIncrCmd): [Bug 2874678]: Don't leak any
	bignums when doing [dict incr] with a value.
	* tests/dict.test (dict-19.3): Memory leak detection code.

2009-10-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclObj.c: [Bug 2871908]: Plug memory leaks of objThreadMap
	and lineCLPtr hashtables.  Also make the names of the continuation
	line information initialization and finalization functions more
	consistent. Patch supplied by Joe Mistachkin <joe@mistachkin.com>.

	* generic/tclIORChan.c (ErrnoReturn): Replace hardwired constant 11
	with proper errno #define, EAGAIN. What was I thinking? The BSD's have
	a different errno assignment and break with the hardwired number.
	Reported by emiliano on the chat.

2009-10-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInterp.c (SlaveEval): Agressive stomping of internal reps
	was added as part of the NRE patch of 2008-07-13.  This doesn't appear
	to actually be needed, and it hurts quite a bit when large lists lose
	their intreps and require reparsing.  Thanks to Ashok Nadkarni for
	reporting the problem.

	* generic/tclTomMathInt.h (new): Public header tclTomMath.h had
	* generic/tclTomMath.h:	dependence on private headers, breaking use
	* generic/tommath.h:	by extensions [Bug 1941434].

2009-10-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/safe.tcl (AliasGlob): Fixed conversion of catch to
	try/finally, it had an 'on ok msg' branch missing, causing a silent
	error immediately, and bogus glob results, breaking search for Tcl
	modules.

2009-10-04  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

2009-09-29  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c:		[Bug 2857044]: Updated freeIntRepProc
	* generic/tclExecute.c:		routines so that they set the typePtr
	* generic/tclIO.c:		field to NULL so that the Tcl_Obj is
	* generic/tclIndexObj.c:	not left in an inconsistent state.
	* generic/tclInt.h:

	* generic/tclInt.h:             guarantee that any size values computed
	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c:     are within the domains of the routines
	they get passed to.  [Bugs 2557696 and 2557796].

2009-09-28  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	Replaced TclProcessReturn() calls with
	* tests/error.test:	Tcl_SetReturnOptions() calls as a simple fix
	for [Bug 2855247].  Thanks to Anton Kovalenko for the report and fix.
	Additional fixes for other failures demonstrated by new tests.

2009-09-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/error.test (error-15.8.*):	Coverage tests illustrating
	flaws in the propagation of return options by [try].

2009-09-26  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclooConfig.sh, win/tclooConfig.sh: [Bug 2026844]: Added dummy
	versions of tclooConfig.sh that make it easier to build extensions
	against both Tcl8.5+TclOO-standalone and Tcl8.6.

2009-09-24  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	TIP #356 IMPLEMENTATION

	* generic/tcl.decls:	Promote internal routine TclNRSubstObj()
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	to public Tcl_NRSubstObj().  Still needs docs.
	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:

	* generic/tclDecls.h:	make genstubs
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:

2009-09-23  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/namespace.n: the description of [namespace unknown] failed
	to mention [namespace path]: fixed. Thx emiliano.

2009-09-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/regexp.test: Added check for error message from
	unbalanced [] in regexp. Added additional simple test cases
	of basic regsub command.

2009-09-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:	Correct botch in the conversion of
	Tcl_SubstObj().  Thanks to Kevin Kenny for detection and report.

2009-09-17  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:	Re-implement Tcl_SubstObj() as a simple
	* generic/tclParse.c:	wrapper around TclNRSubstObj().  This has
	* tests/basic.test:	the effect of caching compiled bytecode in
	* tests/parse.test:	the value to be substituted.  Note that
	Tcl_SubstObj() now exists only for extensions.  Tcl itself no longer
	makes any use of it.  Note also that TclSubstTokens() is now reachable
	only by Tcl_EvalEx() and Tcl_ParseVar() so tests aiming to test its
	functioning needed adjustment to still have the intended effect.

2009-09-16  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c:   Extended ::tcl::unsupported::representation.

2009-09-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Completed the NR-enabling of [subst].

2009-09-11  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/http.test: Added in cleaning up of http tokens for each test
	to reduce amount of global-variable pollution.

2009-09-10  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::Event): [Bug 2849860]: Handle charset
	names in double quotes; some servers like generating them like that.

2009-09-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c:	[Bug 2850901]: Corrected line counting error
	* tests/into.test:	in multi-command script substitutions.

2009-09-07  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Fix potential uninitialized variable use and

2009-09-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSubstCmd): [Bug 2314561]:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Added a bytecode compiler routine for the
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	[subst] command. This is a partial solution to
	* generic/tclCompile.c:	the need to NR-enable [subst] since bytecode
	* generic/tclCompile.h:	execution is already NR-enabled. Two new
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	bytecode instructions, INST_NOP and
	* generic/tclInt.h:	INST_RETURN_CODE_BRANCH were added to support
	* generic/tclParse.c:	the new routine.  INST_RETURN_CODE_BRANCH is
	* tests/basic.test:	likely to be useful in any future effort to
	* tests/info.test:	add a bytecode compiler routine for [try].
	* tests/parse.test:

2009-09-03  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/LinkVar.3: [Bug 2844962]: Added documentation of issues relating
	to use of this API in a multi-threaded environment.

2009-09-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIORTrans.c (ReflectInput): Remove error response to
	0-result from method 'limit?' of transformations. Return the number of
	copied bytes instead, which is possibly nothing. The latter then
	triggers EOF handling in the higher layers, making the 0-result of
	limit? the way to inject artificial EOF's into the data stream.

2009-09-01  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:  Bump to tcltest 2.3.2 after revision

	account for them while counting lines for #280.

2009-08-24  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: Annotate Tcl_Panic as noreturn for clang static
	analyzer in PURIFY builds, replacing preprocessor/assert technique.

	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c: Fix multiple issues with nested event loops
	when CoreFoundation notifier is running in embedded mode. (Fixes

	* tests/fileName.test:

2009-08-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: [Bug 2837800]: Correct the result produced by
	[glob */test] when * matches something like ~foo.

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: [Bug 2806250]: Prevent the storage of strings
	starting with ~ in the "tail" part (normPathPtr field) of the path
	intrep when PATHFLAGS != 0.  This establishes the assumptions relied
	on elsewhere that the name stored there is a relative path.  Also
	refactored to make an AppendPath() routine instead of the cut/paste
	stanzas that were littered throughout.

2009-08-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (TclNRIfObjCmd): [Bug 2823276]: Make [if]

2009-08-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: [Bug 2837800]: Added NULL check to prevent

	* tests/coroutine.test: fix testfile cleanup

2009-08-02  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_RepresentationCmd): Added an unsupported

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclNRWhileObjCmd):

	Extended the bytecode compiler initialization to recognize the
	compilation of whole files (NRE enabled 'source' command) and switch
	to the counting of absolute lines in that case.

	Further extended the bytecode compiler to track the start line in the
	generated information, and modified the bytecode execution to
	recompile an object if the location as per the calling context doesn't
	match the location saved in the bytecode. This part could be optimized
	more by using more memory to keep all possibilities which occur
	around, or by just adjusting the location information instead of a
	total recompile.

	Reworked the handling of literal command arguments in bytecode to be
	saved (compiler) and used (execution) per command (See the
	TCL_INVOKE_STK* instructions), and not per the whole bytecode. This,
	and the previous change remove the problems with location data caused
	by literal sharing (across whole files, but also proc bodies).
	Simplified the associated datastructures (ExtIndex is gone, as is the
	function EnterCmdWordIndex).

	The last change causes the hashtable 'lineLABCPtr' to be state which
	has to be kept per coroutine, like the CmdFrame stack. Reworked the
	coroutine support code to create, delete and switch the information as
	needed. Further reworked the tailcall command as well, it has to pop
	its own arguments when run in a bytecode context to keep a proper
	stack in 'lineLABCPtr'.

	Fixed the mishandling of line information in the NRE-enabled 'for' and
	'while' commands introduced when both were made to share their
	iteration callbacks without taking into account that the loop body is
	found in different words of the command. Introduced a separate data
	structure to hold all the callback information, as we went over the
	limit of 4 direct client-data values for NRE callbacks.

	The above fixes [Bug 1605269].

	* generic/tclCompile.c: [Bug 2802881]: The value stashed in
	* generic/tclProc.c:    iPtr->compiledProcPtr when compiling a proc
	* tests/execute.test:   survives too long. We only need it there long
	enough for the right TclInitCompileEnv() call to re-stash it into
	envPtr->procPtr.  Once that is done, the CompileEnv controls.  If we
	let the value of iPtr->compiledProcPtr linger, though, then any other
	bytecode compile operation that takes place will also have its
	CompileEnv initialized with it, and that's not correct.  The value is
	meant to control the compile of the proc body only, not other compile
	tasks that happen along.  Thanks to Carlos Tasada for discovering and
	reporting the problem.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:       [Bug 2801413]: Revised [format] to not

2009-03-21  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:   Fixed "leaks" in aliases, imports and
	* generic/tclInt.h:     ensembles. Only remaining known leak is in
	* generic/tclInterp.c:  ensemble unknown dispatch (as it not
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:  NR-enabled)
	* tests/tailcall.test:

	* tclInt.h: comments

	* tests/tailcall.test: Added tests to show that [tailcall] does not
	currently always execute in constant space: interp-alias, ns-imports
	and ensembles "leak" as of this commit.

	* tests/nre.test: [foreach] has been NR-enabled for a while, the test
	was marked 'knownBug': unmark it.

	* generic/tclBasic.c:   Fix for (among others) [Bug 2699087]
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:   Tailcalls now perform properly even from
	* generic/tclExecute.c: within [eval]ed scripts.
	* generic/tclInt.h:     More tests missing, as well as proper
	exploration and testing of the interaction with "redirectors" like
	interp-alias (suspect that it does not happen in constant space)
	and pure-eval commands.

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Proper fix for [Bug 2415422]. Reenabled
	* tests/nre.test:       the failing assertion that was disabled on
	2008-12-18: the assertion is correct, the fault was in the
	management of expansions.

	* generic/tclExecute.c:  Fix both test and code for tailcall
	* tests/tailcall.test:   from within a compiled [eval] body.

	* tests/tailcall.test: Slightly improved tests

	commit fixes [Bug 2649975] and [Bug 2695587].

	* tests/coroutine.test:    Moved the tests to their own files,
	* tests/tailcall.test:     removed the unsupported.test. Added

	* generic/tclPosixStr.c (Tcl_SignalId,Tcl_SignalMsg): [Patch 1513655]:
	Added support for SIGINFO, which is present on BSD platforms.

2009-03-14  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.pc.in (new file):		[Patch 2243948] (hat0)
	* unix/configure.in, unix/Makefile.in: Added support for reporting
	Tcl's public build configuration via the pkg-config system. TEA is
	still the official mechanism though, in part because pkg-config is not
	universally supported across all Tcl's supported platforms.

2009-03-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclNRCoroutineObjCmd): fix Tcl_Obj leak.

2009-03-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TryObjCmd, TclNRTryObjCmd): Moved the
	implementation of [try] from Tcl code into C. Still lacks a bytecode
	version, but should be better than what was before.

2009-03-04  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c (TclZlibCmd): Checksums are defined to be unsigned
	32-bit integers, use Tcl_WideInt to pass to scripts. [Bug 2662434]

2009-02-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclStringMatchObj):	[Bug 2637173]: Revised
	the branching on the strObj->typePtr so that untyped values get
	converted to the "string" type and pass through the Unicode matcher.
	[Bug 2613766]: Also added checks to only perform "bytearray"
	optimization on pure bytearray values.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	Since Tcl_GetCharLength() has its own
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	optimizations for the tclByteArrayType, stop
	having the callers do them.

2009-02-24  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/clock.n, doc/fblocked.n, doc/format.n, doc/lsort.n,

	General minor documentation improvements.

	* library/http/http.tcl (geturl, Eof): Added support for 8.6's built
	in zlib routines.

2009-02-22  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/lrange.test:	Revert commits of 2008-07-23. Those were speed
	* tests/binary.test:	tests, that are inherently brittle.

2009-02-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Several revisions to the shimmering
	patterns between Unicode and UTF string reps.  Most notably the
	call: objPtr = Tcl_NewUnicodeObj(...,0); followed by a loop of calls:
	Tcl_AppendUnicodeToObj(objPtr, u, n); will now grow and append to
	the Unicode representation.  Before this commit, the sequence would
	convert each append to UTF and perform the append to the UTF rep.
	This is puzzling and likely a bug.  The performance of [string map]
	is significantly improved by this change (according to the MAP
	collection of benchmarks in tclbench).  Just in case there was some
	wisdom in the old ways that I missed, I left in the ability to restore
	the old patterns with a #define COMPAT 1 at the top of the file.

2009-02-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c:	[Bug 2571597]: Fixed mistaken logic in
	* tests/fileName.test:	TclFSGetPathType() that assumed (not
	"absolute") => "relative". This is a false assumption on Windows,
	where "volumerelative" is another possibility.

2009-02-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Simplify the logic of the
	Tcl_*SetObjLength() routines.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Rewrite GrowStringBuffer() so that it
	has parallel structure with GrowUnicodeBuffer().  The revision permits
	allocation attempts to continue all the way up to failure, with no
	gap. It also directly manipulates the String and Tcl_Obj internals
	instead of inefficiently operating via Tcl_*SetObjLength() with all of
	its extra protections and underdocumented special cases.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Another round of simplification on
	the allocation macros.

2009-02-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tcl.m4, win/configure: Check if cl groks _WIN64 already to
	avoid CC manipulation that can screw up later configure checks.
	Use 'd'ebug runtime in 64-bit builds.

2009-02-17  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Pare back the length of the unicode
	array in a non-extended String struct to one Tcl_UniChar, meant to
	hold the terminating NUL character.  Non-empty unicode strings are
	then stored by extending the String struct by stringPtr->maxChars
	additional slots in that array with sizeof(Tcl_UniChar) bytes per
	slot. This revision makes the allocation macros much simpler.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Factor out common GrowUnicodeBuffer()
	and solve overflow and growth algorithm fallbacks in it.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Factor out common GrowStringBuffer().

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Convert Tcl_AppendStringsToObj into
	* tests/stringObj.test:		a radically simpler implementation
	where we just loop over calls to Tcl_AppendToObj.  This fixes [Bug
	2597185].  It also creates a *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY *** in
	that T_ASTO can now allocate more space than is strictly required,
	like all the other Tcl_Append* routines.  The incompatibility was
	detected by test stringObj-6.5, which I've updated to reflect the
	new behavior.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Revise buffer growth implementation
	in ExtendStringRepWithUnicode.  Use cheap checks to determine that
	no reallocation is necessary without cost of computing the precise
	number of bytes needed.  Also make use of the string growth algortihm
	in the case of repeated appends.

2009-02-16  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c:	Hack needed for official zlib1.dll build.
	* win/configure.in:	fix [Feature Request 2605263] use official
	* win/Makefile.in:	zlib build.
	* win/configure:	(regenerated)
	* compat/zlib/zdll.lib:	new files
	* compat/zlib/zlib1.dll:

	* win/Makefile.in:  [Bug 2605232]: tdbc doesn't build when Tcl is
	compiled with --disable-shared.

2009-02-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	[Bug 2603158]: Added protections from
	* generic/tclTestObj.c:		invalid memory accesses when we append
	* tests/stringObj.test:		(some part of) a Tcl_Obj to itself.
	Added the appendself and appendself2 subcommands to the
	[teststringobj] testing command and added tests to the test suite.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Factor out duplicate code from
	Tcl_AppendObjToObj.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Replace the 'size_t uallocated' field
	of the String struct, storing the number of bytes allocated to store
	the Tcl_UniChar array, with an 'int maxChars' field, storing the
	number of Tcl_UniChars that may be stored in the allocated space.
	This reduces memory requirement a small bit, and makes some range
	checks simpler to code.
	* generic/tclTestObj.c:	Replace the [teststringobj ualloc] testing
	* tests/stringObj.test:	command with [teststringobj maxchars] and
	update the tests.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Removed limitation in
	Tcl_AppendObjToObj where the char length of the result was only
	computed if the appended string was all single byte characters.
	This limitation was in place to dodge a bug in Tcl_GetUniChar.
	With that bug gone, we can take advantage of always recording the
	length of append results when we know it.

2009-02-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Revisions so that we avoid creating
	the strange representation of an empty string with
	objPtr->bytes == NULL and stringPtr->hasUnicode == 0.  Instead in
	the situations where that was being created, create a traditional
	two-legged stork representation (objPtr->bytes = tclEmptyStringRep
	and stringPtr->hasUnicode = 1).  In the situations where the strange
	rep was treated differently, continue to do so by testing
	stringPtr->numChars == 0 to detect it.  These changes make the code
	more conventional so easier for new maintainers to pick up.  Also
	sets up further simplifications.

	* generic/tclTestObj.c:	Revise updates to [teststringobj] so we don't
	get blocked by MODULE_SCOPE limits.

2009-02-12  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Rewrites of the routines
	Tcl_GetCharLength, Tcl_GetUniChar, Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj,
	Tcl_GetRange, and TclStringObjReverse to use the new macro, and
	to more simply and clearly split the cases depending on whether
	a valid unicode rep is present or needs to be created.
	New utility routine UnicodeLength(), to compute the length of unicode
	buffer arguments when no length is passed in, with built-in
	overflow protection included.  Update three callers to use it.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	New macro TclNumUtfChars meant to be a faster
	replacement for a full Tcl_NumUtfChars() call when the string has all
	single-byte characters.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Simplified Tcl_GetCharLength by
	* generic/tclTestObj.c:		removing code that did nothing.
	Added early returns from Tcl_*SetObjLength when the desired length
	is already present; adapted test command to the change.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Re-implemented AppendUtfToUnicodeRep
	so that we no longer pass through Tcl_DStrings which have their own
	sets of problems when lengths overflow the int range.  Now AUTUR and
	FillUnicodeRep share a common core routine.

2009-02-12  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOODefineCmds.c (TclOOGetDefineCmdContext): Use the
	correct field in the Interp structure for retrieving the frame to get
	the context object so that people can extend [oo::define] without deep
	shenanigans. Bug found by Federico Ferri.

2009-02-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Re-implemented AppendUnicodeToUtfRep
	so that we no longer pass through Tcl_DStrings which have their own
	sets of problems when lengths overflow the int range.  Now AUTUR and
	UpdateStringOfString share a common core routine.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Changed type of the 'allocated' field
	* generic/tclTestObj.c:		of the String struct (and the
	TestString counterpart) from size_t to int since only int values are
	ever stored in it.

	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_GetStringFromObj): Reduce code duplication.

2009-02-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInterp.c:	Reverted the conversion of [interp] into an
	* tests/interp.test:	ensemble.  Such conversion is not necessary
	* tests/nre.test:	(or even all that helpful) in the NRE-enabling
	of [interp invokehidden], and it has other implications -- including
	significant forkage of the 8.5 and 8.6 implementations -- that are
	better off avoided if there's no gain.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (STRING_NOMEM):  [Bug 2494093]: Add missing
	cast of NULL to (char *) that upsets some compilers.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_(Attempt)SetObjLength):	[Bug 2553906]:
	Added protections against callers asking for negative lengths.  It is
	likely when this happens that an integer overflow is to blame.

2009-02-01  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Allow nmake flags such as -a (rebuild all) to pass
	down to the pkgs targets, too.

2009-01-30  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/chan.n: [Bug 1216074]: Added another extended example.

	* doc/refchan.n: Added an example of how to build a scripted channel.

2009-01-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/stringObj.test: [Bug 2006888]: Remove non-ASCII chars from
	non-comment locations in the file, making it work more reliably in
	locales with a non-Latin-1 default encoding.

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_FindCommand): [Bug 2519474]: Ensure that
	the path is not searched when the TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY flag is given.

	* generic/tclOODecls.h (Tcl_OOInitStubs): [Bug 2537839]: Make the
	declaration of this macro work correctly in the non-stub case.

2009-01-29  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInterp.c:	Convert the [interp] command into a
	* tests/interp.test:	[namespace ensemble].  Work in progress
	* tests/nre.test:	to NRE-enable the [interp invokehidden]
	subcommand.

2009-01-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (TclMakeEnsemble): [Bug 2529117]: Make this
	function behave more sensibly when presented with a fully-qualified
	name, rather than doing strange stuff.

2009-01-28  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclInvokeObjectCommand): Made this understand
	what to do if it ends up being used on a command with no objProc; that
	shouldn't happen, but...

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (TclMakeEnsemble): [Bug 2529157]: Made this
	understand NRE command implementations better.
	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictForCmd): Eliminate unnecessary command
	implementation.

2009-01-27  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclOODefineCmds.c (Tcl_ClassSetConstructor):
	[Bug 2531577]: Ensure that caches of constructor chains are cleared
	when the constructor is changed.

2009-01-26  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:   [Bug 1028264]: WSACleanup() too early.
	* generic/tclEvent.c: The fix introduces "late exit handlers" for
	* win/tclWinSock.c:   similar late process-wide cleanups.

2009-01-26  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinSock.c: [Bug 2446662]: Resync Win behavior on RST with
	that of unix (EOF).

2009-01-26  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclZlib.c (ChanClose): [Bug 2536400]: Only generate error
	messages in the interpreter when the thread is not being closed down.

2009-01-23  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/zlib.n: Added a note that 'zlib push' is reversed by 'chan pop'.

2009-01-22  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h:	CONSTify TclPrintInstruction (TIP #27)
	* generic/tclCompile.c
	* generic/tclInt.h:	CONSTify TclpNativeJoinPath (TIP #27)
	* generic/tclFileName.c
	* generic/tcl.decls:	{unix win} is equivalent to {generic}
	* generic/tclInt.decls
	* generic/tclDecls.h:	(regenerated)
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h
	* generic/tclGetDate.y:	Single internal const decoration.
	* generic/tclDate.c:

2009-01-22  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/tcl.m4: Corrected a typo ($(SHLIB_VERSION) should be
	${SHLIB_VERSION}).
	* unix/configure: Autoconf 2.59

2009-01-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIORChan.c (ReflectClose): [Bug 2458202]:
	* generic/tclIORTrans.c (ReflectClose): Closing a channel may supply
	NULL for the 'interp'. Test for finalization needs to be different,
	and one place has to pull the interp out of the channel instead.

2009-01-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c: New fix for [Bug 2494093] replaces the
	flawed attempt committed 2009-01-09.

2009-01-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/Makefile.in: [Patch 907924]:Added a CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR
	* unix/tcl.m4:      parameter so that distributors can control where
	tclConfig.sh goes. Made the installation of 'ldAix' conditional upon
	actually being on an AIX system. Allowed for downstream packagers to
	customize SHLIB_VERSION on BSD-derived systems. Thanks to Stuart
	Cassoff for his help.
	* unix/configure: Autoconf 2.59

2009-01-19  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/build.vc.bat: Improved tools detection and error message
	* win/makefile.vc: Reorganized the $(TCLOBJ) file list into seperate
	parts for easier maintenance. Matched all sources built using -GL to
	both $(lib) and $(link) to use -LTCG and avoid a warning message.
	Addressed the over-building nature of the htmlhelp target by moving
	from a pseudo target to a real target dependent on the entire docs/
	directory contents.
	* win/nmakehlp.c: Removed -g option and GrepForDefine() func as it
	isn't being used anymore. The -V option method is much better.

2009-01-16  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:	Bump patchlevel to 8.6b1.1 to distinguish
	* library/init.tcl:	CVS snapshots from the 8.6b1 and 8.6b2 releases
	* unix/configure.in:	and to deal with the fact that the 8.6b1
	* win/configure.in:	version of init.tcl will not [source] in the
	HEAD version of Tcl.

	* unix/configure:	autoconf-2.59
	* win/configure:

2009-01-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken):	Reverted most
	of the substance of my 2009-01-12 commit. NULLing the objProc field of
	a Command when deleting it is important so that tests for certain
	classes of commands don't return false positives when applied to
	deleted command tokens. Overall change is now just replacement of a
	false comment with a true one.

2009-01-13  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4: [Bug 2502365]: Building of head on HPUX is broken when
	using the native CC.
	* unix/configure (autoconf-2.59)

2009-01-13  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_ThrowObjCmd):	Move implementation of [throw]
	* library/init.tcl (throw):		to C from Tcl.

2009-01-12  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken): One consequence of
	the NRE rewrite is that there are now situations where a NULL objProc
	field in a Command struct is perfectly normal. Removed an outdated
	comment in Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken that claimed we use
	cmdPtr->objPtr==NULL as a test of command validity. In fact we use
	cmdPtr->flags&CMD_IS_DELETED to perform that test. Also removed the
	setting to NULL, since any extension following the advice of the old
	comment is going to be broken by NRE anyway, and needs to shift to
	flag-based testing (or stop intruding into such internal matters).
	Part of [Bug 2486550].

2009-01-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (STRING_SIZE): [Bug 2494093]: Corrected
	failure to limit memory allocation requests to the sizes that can be
	supported by Tcl's memory allocation routines.

2009-01-09  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (NamespaceEnsembleCmd): [Bug 1558654]: Error out
	when someone gives wrong # of args to [namespace ensemble create].

2009-01-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (STRING_UALLOC): [Bug 2494093]: Added missing
	parens required to get correct results out of things like
	STRING_UALLOC(num + append).

2009-01-08  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c, generic/tclIndexObj.c, generic/tclListObj.c,
	* generic/tclObj.c, generic/tclStrToD.c, generic/tclUtil.c,
	* generic/tclVar.c: Generate errorcodes for the error cases which
	approximate to "I can't interpret that string as one of those" and
	"You gave me the wrong number of arguments".

2009-01-07  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/dict.n: [Tk Bug 2491235]: Added more examples.

	* tests/oo.test (oo-22.1): Adjusted test to be less dependent on the
	specifics of how [info frame] reports general frame information, and
	instead to focus on what methods add to it; that's really what the
	test is about anyway.

2009-01-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/stringObj.test:	Revise tests that demand a NULL Tcl_ObjType
	in certain values to construct those values with [testdstring] so
	there's no lack of robustness depending on the shimmer history of
	shared literals.

2009-01-06  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictIncrCmd): Corrected twiddling in internals
	of dictionaries so that literals can't get destroyed.

	* tests/expr.test: [Bug 2006879]: Eliminate non-ASCII char.

	* generic/tclOOInfo.c (InfoObjectMethodsCmd,InfoClassMethodsCmd):
	[Bug 2489836]: Only delete pointers that were actually allocated!

	* generic/tclOO.c (TclNRNewObjectInstance, Tcl_NewObjectInstance):
	[Bug 2481109]: Perform search for existing commands in right context.

2009-01-05  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclNRSourceObjCmd): [Bug 2412068]: Make
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (TclNREvalFile):    implementation of the
	[source] command be NRE enabled so that [yield] inside a script
	sourced in a coroutine can work.

2009-01-04  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c: Tidy up spacing and code style.

2009-01-03  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl (tcl::clock::add): Fixed error message formatting
	in the case where [clock add] is presented with a bad switch.
	* tests/clock.test (clock-65.1) Added a test case for the above
	problem [Bug 2481670].

2009-01-02  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): [Bug 878333]: Force the use of the
	compatibility version of mkstemp() on IRIX.
	* unix/configure.in, unix/Makefile.in (mkstemp.o):
	* compat/mkstemp.c (new file): [Bug 741967]: Added a compatibility
	implementation of the mkstemp() function, which is apparently needed
	on some platforms.
