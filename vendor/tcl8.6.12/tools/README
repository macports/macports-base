Generating HTML files.
The tcltk-man2html.tcl script generates a nice set of HTML with
good cross references. Use it like
    cd unix
    ./configure
    make html
This script is very picky about the organization of man pages,
effectively acting as a style enforcer.
The resulting documentation can be found at
    /tmp/dist/tcl<version>/html
