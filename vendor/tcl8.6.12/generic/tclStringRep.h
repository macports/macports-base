/*
 * tclStringRep.h --
 *
 *	This file contains the definition of the Unicode string internal
 *	representation and macros to access it.
 *
 *	A Unicode string is an internationalized string. Conceptually, a
 *	Unicode string is an array of 16-bit quantities organized as a
 *	sequence of properly formed UTF-8 characters. There is a one-to-one
 *	map between Unicode and UTF characters. Because Unicode characters
 *	have a fixed width, operations such as indexing operate on Unicode
 *	data. The String object is optimized for the case where each UTF char
 *	in a string is only one byte. In this case, we store the value of
 *	numChars, but we don't store the Unicode data (unless Tcl_GetUnicode
 *	is explicitly called).
 *
 *	The String object type stores one or both formats. The default
 *	behavior is to store UTF. Once Unicode is calculated by a function, it
 *	is stored in the internal rep for future access (without an additional
 *	O(n) cost).
 *
 *	To allow many appends to be done to an object without constantly
 *	reallocating the space for the string or Unicode representation, we
 *	allocate double the space for the string or Unicode and use the
 *	internal representation to keep track of how much space is used vs.
 *	allocated.

/*
 * The following structure is the internal rep for a String object. It keeps
 * track of how much memory has been used and how much has been allocated for
 * the Unicode and UTF string to enable growing and shrinking of the UTF and
 * Unicode reps of the String object with fewer mallocs. To optimize string
 * length and indexing operations, this structure also stores the number of
 * characters (same of UTF and Unicode!) once that value has been computed.
 *
 * Under normal configurations, what Tcl calls "Unicode" is actually UTF-16
 * restricted to the Basic Multilingual Plane (i.e. U+00000 to U+0FFFF). This
 * can be officially modified by altering the definition of Tcl_UniChar in
 * tcl.h, but do not do that unless you are sure what you're doing!
