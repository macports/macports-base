This is libsolv, a free package dependency solver using a satisfiability
algorithm.

This code is based on two major, but independent, blocks:

 1. Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package
    and dependency information.

 2. Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for
    resolving package dependencies.

The sat-solver code has been written to aim for the newest packages,
record the decison tree to provide introspection, and also allows to
provide the user with suggestions on how to deal with unsolvable
problems. It also takes advantage of the repository storage to
minimize memory usage.

Supported package formats:
  - rpm/rpm5
  - deb
  - arch linux
  - haiku

Supported repository formats:
  - rpmmd (primary, filelists, comps, deltainfo/presto, updateinfo)
  - susetags, suse product formats
  - mandriva/mageia (synthesis, info, files)
  - arch linux
  - red carpet helix format
  - haiku
