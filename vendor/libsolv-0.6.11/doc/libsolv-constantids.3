.SH "NAME"
libsolv-constantids \- fixed Ids for often used strings
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Constant Ids are Ids of strings that are often needed\&. They are defined to ease programming and reduce the number of pool_str2id calls\&. The constant Ids are part of the binary ABI of libsolv, a minor version update will only add new constants and not change existing Ids to maintain compatible\&. The on\-disk solv format works does not use the fixed Ids, but instead references the strings, so solv files can still be read when the ABI is broken\&.
