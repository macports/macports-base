Name
----
testsolv - run a libsolv testcase through the solver

Synopsis
--------
*testsolv* ['OPTIONS'] 'TESTCASE'

Description
-----------
The testsolv tools can be used to run a testcase. Testcases can
either be manually created to test specific features, or they
can be written by libsolv's testcase_write function. This is useful
to evaluate bug reports about the solver.

*-v*::
Increase the debug level of the solver. This option can be specified
multiple times to further increase the amount of debug data.

*-r*::
Write the output in testcase format instead of human readable text.
The output can then be used in the result section of the test case.
If the *-r* option is given twice, the output is formated for
verbatim inclusion.

*-l* 'PKGSPEC'::
Instead of running the solver, list packages in the repositories.

*-s* 'SOLUTIONSPEC'::
This is used in the solver test suite to test the calculated solutions
to encountered problems.
