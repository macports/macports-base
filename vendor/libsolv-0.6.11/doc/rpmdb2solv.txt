Name
----
rpmdb2solv - convert the rpm database into a solv file

Synopsis
--------
*rpmdb2solv* ['OPTIONS'] ['REFFILE.solv']

Description
-----------
The rpmdb2solv tool reads rpm's installed packages database
and writes it in solv file format to standard output. You can
make use of an old version of the database by specifying a
'REFFILE.solv' file.

*-o* 'OUTFILE'::
Write the generated solv to 'OUTFILE' instead of standard output.

*-P*::
Print percentages as packages are being read in. The output
format is like rpm's --percent option.

*-r* 'ROOTDIR'::
Use 'ROOTDIR' as root directory.

*-k*::
Read pubkeys from the rpm database instead of installed packages.
Note that many distributions stopped storing pubkeys in the
database but use a directory like */var/lib/rpm/pubkeys*
instead.

*-A*::
Also scan the */usr/share/appdata* for installed appdata files
and create pseudo packages for each file.

*-p* 'PRODDIR'::
Also read SUSE product files from directory 'PRODDIR'. The
standard directory is */etc/products.d*.

*-n*::
Do not read any packages from the rpm database. This is useful
together with *-p* to only convert SUSE products.

*-X*::
Autoexpand SUSE pattern and product provides into packages.
