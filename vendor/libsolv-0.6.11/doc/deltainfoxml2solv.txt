deltainfoxml2solv - convert rpm-md's deltainfo format into a solv file

Synopsis
--------
*deltainfoxml2solv* ['OPTIONS']

Description
-----------
The deltainfoxml2solv tool reads rpm-md's *deltainfo.xml* data from stdin,
and writes it as solv file to standard output. Some distributions name
the input *prestodelta.xml* instead. Each delta rpm element is converted
and added as *repository:deltainfo* element to the meta section of the
solv file.
