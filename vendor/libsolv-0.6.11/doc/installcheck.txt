Name
----
installcheck - find out which packages cannot be installed

Synopsis
--------
*installcheck* 'ARCH' 'REPO1' 'REPO2'... *--nocheck* 'NREPO1' 'NREPO2'...

Description
-----------
The installcheck tool checks if all packages in 'REPO1'...'REPON' are
installable. A package is installable if there is a set of packages
from the repositories that satisfies its dependencies. The repositories
after the *--nocheck* option are only used for dependency resolving,
but the tool does not check if the packages in them are installable.

A Repository can be a solv file, a rpmmd *primary.xml.gz* file, a SUSE
*packages* or *packages.gz* file, or a Debian *Packages* or *Packages.gz*
file.
