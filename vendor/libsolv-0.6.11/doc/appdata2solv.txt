Name
----
appdata2solv - convert application meta data into a solv file

Synopsis
--------
*appdata2solv* ['OPTIONS']

Description
-----------
The appdata format contains metadata about application. It can
be available both in repositories (for available applications)
and in the installed system (for installed applications).
The appdata2solv tool reads the metadata from stdin and
writes the parsed data as solv file to standard output. The
parser will create *application:* pseudo packages for each entry.

*-d* 'APPDATADIR'::
Do not read from standard input, instead scan the specified
directory for appdata entries. 'APPDATADIR' is normally
set to */usr/share/appdata*.

*-r* 'ROOTDIR'::
Use 'ROOTDIR' as root directory.
