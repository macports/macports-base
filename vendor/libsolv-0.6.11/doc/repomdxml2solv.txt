Name
----
repomdxml2solv - convert a repomd.xml file into a solv file

Synopsis
--------
*repomdxml2solv* ['OPTIONS']

Description
-----------
The repomd.xml file is the index file of a rpm-md repository,
containing references to all data file with checksums. The
repomdxml2solv tool reads the repomd.xml file from stdin and
writes the parsed data as solv file to standard output. The
data is stored as meta attributes in the result.

*-q* 'WHAT'::
Data query mode: instead of writing a solv file, select the
'WHAT' element in the input data and write it to standard output.
Examples for 'WHAT' are *type* to get a list of all types, and
*primary:location* to get the location of the element with
type *primary*.
