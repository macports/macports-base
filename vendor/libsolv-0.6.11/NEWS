This file contains the major changes between
libsolv versions:

Version 0.6.0:
- ABI change: cleaned up and reordered knownid.h
- added support for sha224/sha384/sha512
- API change in the bindings:
  * dropped solvid arg from most Dataiterator
    constructors
  * changed Datamatch results from methods to
    attributes
  * automatically delete the pool if the owner
    object is freed (use the disown method to
    get the old behavior).
- new functions:
  * pool_add_userinstalled_jobs
  * solver_get_userinstalled
