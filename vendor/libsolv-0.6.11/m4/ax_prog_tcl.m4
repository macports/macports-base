# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_TCL([min-version])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Searches for tcl (tclsh and wish) in PATH and checks which version is
#   installed. The macro bails out if either tcl is not found or the minimum
#   version is not satisfied, unless minimum version is "0".
#
#   Example:
#
#    AX_PROG_TCL
#
#   This checks for tcl and if not found, exits with an error. If found, it
#   prints tcl path and version number.
#
#    AX_PROG_TCL([8.0])
#
#   Checks for tcl and exits with an error if its not found or the version
#   is below 8.0.
