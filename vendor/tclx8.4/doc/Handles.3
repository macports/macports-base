.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Tcl handle facility provides a way to manage table entries that may be
referenced by a textual handle from Tcl code.  This is provided for 
applications that need to create data structures in one command, return a
reference (i.e. pointer) to that particular data structure and then access
that data structure in other commands. An example application is file handles.
.PP
A handle consists of a base name, which is some unique, meaningful name, such
as `\fBfile\fR' and a numeric value appended to the base name (e.g. `file3').
The handle facility is designed to provide a standard mechanism for building
Tcl commands that allocate and access table entries based on an entry index.
The tables are expanded when needed, consequently pointers to entries should
not be kept, as they will become invalid when the table is expanded.  If the
table entries are large or pointers must be kept to the entries, then the
the entries should be allocated separately and pointers kept in the handle 
table.  A use count is kept on the table.  This use count is intended to
determine when a table shared by multiple commands is to be release.
'
.SS Tcl_HandleTblInit
Create and initialize a Tcl dynamic handle table.  The use count on the
table is set to one.
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIhandleBase\fR - The base name of the handle, the handle will be
returned in the form "baseNN", where NN is the table entry number.
.br
\fBo \fIentrySize\fR - The size of an entry, in bytes.
.br
\fBo \fIinitEntries\fR - Initial size of the table, in entries.
.RE
.PP
Returns:
.RS 2
A pointer to the table header.  
.RE
'
.SS Tcl_HandleTblUseCount
.PP
Alter the handle table use count by the specified amount, which can be
positive or negative.  Amount may be zero to retrieve the use count.
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIheaderPtr\fR - Pointer to the table header.
.br
\fBo \fIamount\fR - The amount to alter the use count by.
.RE
.PP
Returns:
.RS 2
The resulting use count.
.RE
'
.SS Tcl_HandleTblRelease
.PP
Decrement the use count on a Tcl dynamic handle table.  If the count
goes to zero or negative, then release the table.
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIheaderPtr\fR - Pointer to the table header.
.RE
'
.SS Tcl_HandleAlloc
.PP
Allocate an entry and associate a handle with it.
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIheaderPtr\fR - A pointer to the table header.
.br
\fBo \fIhandlePtr\fR - Buffer to return handle in. It must be big enough to
hold the name.
.RE
.PP
Returns:
.RS 2
A pointer to the allocated entry (user part).
.RE
'
.SS Tcl_HandleXlate
.PP
Translate a handle to a entry pointer.
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIinterp\fR - A error message may be returned in result.
.br
\fBo \fIheaderPtr\fR - A pointer to the table header.
.sp
o \fIhandle\fR - The handle assigned to the entry.
.RE
.PP
Returns:
.RS 2
A pointer to the entry, or NULL if an error occurred.
.RE
'
.SS Tcl_HandleWalk
.PP
Walk through and find every allocated entry in a table.  Entries may
be deallocated during a walk, but should not be allocated.
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIheaderPtr\fR - A pointer to the table header.
.br
\fBo \fIwalkKeyPtr\fR - Pointer to a variable to use to keep track of the
place in the table.  The variable should be initialized to -1 before
the first call.
.RE
Returns:
.RS 2
A pointer to the next allocated entry, or NULL if there are not more.
.RE
'
.SS Tcl_WalkKeyToHandle
.PP
Convert a walk key, as returned from a call to Tcl_HandleWalk into a
handle.  The Tcl_HandleWalk must have succeeded.
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIheaderPtr\fR - A pointer to the table header.
.br
\fBo \fIwalkKey\fR - The walk key.
.br
\fBo \fIhandlePtr\fR - Buffer to return handle in. It must be big enough to
hold the name.
.RE
'
.SS Tcl_HandleFree
.PP
Frees a handle table entry.
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIheaderPtr\fR - A pointer to the table header.
.br
\fBo \fIentryPtr\fR - Entry to free.
