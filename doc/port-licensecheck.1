.SH "NAME"
port-licensecheck \- Check whether a port is disbributable

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBport licensecheck\fR checks whether a port is distributable, meaning that not only does the license allow distribution, but so do its dependencies, and none of those dependencies cause license conflicts\&.
.sp
By default, it is assumed that ports may use libraries or headers from their dependencies and thus form a derivative work\&. A dependency with an incompatible license thus prevents the port from being distributed in binary form\&. If a dependency with an incompatible license is not used in such a way that a derivative work is formed, or should not prevent binary distribution for any other reason, list it in license_noconflict, see \fBportfile\fR(7)\&.
.sp
As an example, assume a port, A, is licensed under the GNU General Public License and depends on B, which is licensed under a BSD license\&. Now, if B depends on OpenSSL, we have a conflict, as the GPL conflicts with its license\&. In this case, we \fIcould\fR list port B in license_noconflict, but this requires careful inspection, and at the very least a comment in the Portfile\&. The most common case where it is safe to mark a license as non\-conflicting are:

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If a port only a invokes a dependency as a build tool, it is most likely safe to list\&.

.el \{\

If a port invokes a dependency as a tool, i\&.e\&. by executing its binaries, it may be safe to list\&.

If a port links against a dependency using dynamic linking or some form of higher\-level object oriented environment, it is probably not safe to list\&.
.RE
.sp
The above points should only be taken as examples and general guidelines; any addition of license_noconflict should probably go through a review on GitHub to ensure that the change is safe\&.
.sp
The MacPorts infrastructure only offers binary archives that pass this test\&.
