# svn props set on them and start with a commented out Id tag, which
# the server will expand:
# $Id$

# Following that comes the PortSystem declaration:
# PortSystem <version>
# where version is the version of the ports system your port relies upon.
# This can NOT be commented out.

# Dependencies are defined by three settings:
#    depends_lib:   installed at build time and at install time
#    depends_run:   installed at install time
#    depends_build: installed at build time
#
#    These options accept a list of depspecs. Depspecs are ':' delimited three
#    value lists of type:match:portname. The following types are supported:
#
#   lib - The lib type requires the match argument in the
#           format <libraryname>.<major version>
#   bin - The bin type requires the match argument to be the full
#           executable name
#   <path>  - If a full path is specified as the type, the math argument
#           must be a complete regexp.
#   portname must be the name of a valid port to build and install
#   if the depspec is not matched.
#   An alternative dependency depspec is the port:<portname> syntax,
#   used when you want to insure the given dependency is satisfied
#   exclusively by MacPorts.
depends_build       port:pkgconfig
depends_lib         port:gettext

# The type of configuration script this port uses.
#configure.type      gnu

# A list of configuration time arguments you might want to pass to the configure script:
configure.args      --mandir=${prefix}/share/man

# The directory name of the subdirectory of work/ where this port extracts
#worksrcdir          glib

# Alternative ways to build the port, packed as 'variants'
