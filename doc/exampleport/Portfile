# All ports must have the "svn:keywords : Id" and "svn:eol-style : native"
# svn props set on them and start with a commented out Id tag, which
# the server will expand:
# $Id$

# Following that comes the PortSystem declaration:
# PortSystem <version>
# where version is the version of the ports system your port relies upon.
# This can NOT be commented out.

# Dependencies are defined by three settings:
#    depends_lib:	installed at build time and at install time
#    depends_run:	installed at install time
#    depends_build:	installed at build time
#
#    These options accept a list of depspecs. Depspecs are ':' delimited three
#    value lists of type:match:portname. The following types are supported:
#
#	lib	- The lib type requires the match argument in the
#		    format <libraryname>.<major version>
#	bin	- The bin type requires the match argument to be the full
#		    executable name
#	<path>  - If a full path is specified as the type, the math argument
#		    must be a complete regexp.
#	portname must be the name of a valid port to build and install
#	if the depspec is not matched.
#	An alternative dependency depspec is the port:<portname> syntax,
#	used when you want to insure the given dependency is satisfied
#	exclusively by MacPorts.
depends_build	    port:pkgconfig
depends_lib	    port:gettext

# The type of configuration script this port uses.
#configure.type     gnu

# A list of configuration time arguments you might want to pass to the configure script:
configure.args   --mandir=${prefix}/share/man

# The directory name of the subdirectory of work/ where this port extracts
#worksrcdir	glib

# Alternative ways to build the port, packed as 'variants'
