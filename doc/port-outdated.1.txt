NAME
----
port-outdated - List outdated ports

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-q*] *outdated*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port outdated* lists all ports that have newer versions available. For each
port, it prints the name and both the old and the new version. *port outdated*
will give you the reason why MacPorts considers a port to be outdated. This
could be

 - due to an update, i.e. if the version number increased,
 - due to a revision bump, i.e. a higher revision,
 - due to an epoch increase (used in situations where the version number
   decreased, but the port still is newer than the previous one), or
 - due to an OS upgrade. MacPorts will consider ports built on a previous
   version of macOS outdated.
    
The ports listed in *port outdated* are the ports that will be upgraded when you
run

----
$> sudo port upgrade outdated
----

i.e. those the 'outdated' pseudo-port selector expands to, with one exception:
If you have the newest version of a port installed, but deactivated in favor of
an older version, *port outdated* will list it as outdated, but *sudo port
upgrade outdated* will not upgrade it. This can be used to intentionally stay at
an older version of a port, e.g. if the newer version does not work as expected.
Note that MacPorts will still install newer versions of such ports if they are
dependencies of other ports to be installed or upgraded.
