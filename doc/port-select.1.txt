NAME
----
port-select - Switch between different implementations of a tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-dv*] *select* --summary

[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-dv*] *select* --show 'group'

[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-dv*] *select* [--list] 'group'

[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-dv*] *select* [--set] 'group' 'option'

[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-dv*] *select* [--add] 'group' 'target' 'name':'link' ['name':'link'...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port select* provides a mechanism to choose from different implementations of
a common tool or port. Selecting one of the options makes it the primary version
or implementation, e.g. the one to be run by default when you do not explicitly
select a version or implementation on the command line.

Note that *port select* is only for your convenience as user. It does not, for
example, affect which compiler MacPorts uses when it compiles software, or
against which copy of MySQL a port builds. If there is a user-visible choice, it
is usually offered as a variant on the port. If the *port select* mechanism
affects how a port builds, that should be considered a bug.

One example is the set of MySQL and forks of MySQL, where there are mysql51,
mysql55, mysql56, mariadb, mariadb-10.0, mariadb-11.0, percona, possibly among
others. *port select* lets you choose which of these becomes the version run,
when you simply run 'mysql' or other commands from the MySQL suite.

*port select* has multiple modes of operation: It can display a summary, show
the current primary implementation and list all available implementations given
a group name, and change the primary implementation. See *OPTIONS* below for
details.

OPTIONS
-------
*--summary*::
    Display a summary of all available selection groups, their current primary
    implementation and a list of all available choices.

*--show* 'group'::
    Print the current primary implementation for the given group.

*--list* 'group'::
    Print a list of all currently available choices for the given group. This is
    the default when *port select* is called with one argument.

*--set* 'group' 'option'::
    Make 'option' the primary selection for the 'group' group. This is the
    default when *port select* is called with two arguments.

*--add* 'group' 'target' 'name':'link' ['name':'link'...]::
    Add a new select group 'group' that provides 'target' with the available
    selections. Each 'link' in a 'name':'link' can be either a relative or
    absolute path (relative paths are relative to the MacPorts prefix).

EXAMPLES
--------
If you have both the mysql56 and the percona port installed, you can switch your
implementation of the 'mysql' command by running
----
$> sudo port select --set mysql $option
----
where '$option' is 'mysql56' if you want the version from MySQL, or 'percona',
if you want the version from Percona.

If you have two versions of clang installed (say, clang-12 and clang-13) and you
want to provide a default clangd at ${prefix}/bin/clangd, use
---
$> sudo port select --add clangd bin/clangd clangd-12:bin/clangd-mp-12 clangd-13:bin/clangd-mp-13
