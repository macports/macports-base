.Os 
.Sh NAME
macports.conf
.Nd Configuration file of the MacPorts system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm macports.conf
is the configuration file used to bootstrap the MacPorts system. This file is read by the
.Nm port
command and determines how it behaves. Lines beginning with '#' are comments, empty lines are ignored.
The format is that of a simple key/value space or tab separated pair.
.Pp
The file contains entries of the form:
.Pp
.Dl Va "<key> <value>"
.Pp
The value of any given key can be referred to by the '${<keyname>}' abstraction, where <keyname> expands
to the key in question.
.Pp
.Sh KEYS
The following keys are used by
.Nm port
itself:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width lc
.It Va prefix
Sets the directory where ports are installed. Any path may be used but those with spaces and/or non ascii
characters should be avoided, as this can broke some ports. This key is often referred to as '${prefix}'.
.br
.Ic Default:
/opt/local
.It Va portdbpath
Directory where MacPorts keeps working data as downloaded sources, installed ports receipts
and the main registry. Same path restrictions apply as for '${prefix}'.
.br
.Ic Default:
${prefix}/var/macports
.It Va portdbformat
Storage type to use for the MacPorts registry. Currently the only supported format is "flat".
.br
.Ic Default:
flat
.It Va portinstalltype
Sets the mode in which ports are installed by MacPorts. Supported values are 'direct' or 'image'.
The 'direct' mode is often used on systems that do not support 'image' due to limitations in their
installed version of Tcl. In 'direct' mode ports are installed directly into '${prefix}' and only
one flavor of a port can be installed at any given time. In 'image' mode multiple flavors of a port
(i.e., different versions and/or any possible combination of its variants) can be installed concurrently
into '${portdbpath}/software/${portname}' and only one can be "activated" onto '${prefix}' via soft or
hard links from the former to the latter.
.br
.Ic Default:
image
.It Va applications_dir
Directory containing Applications installed from ports.
.br
.Ic Default:
/Applications/MacPorts
.It Va frameworks_dir
Directory containing Frameworks installed from ports.
.br
.Ic Default:
${prefix}/Library/Frameworks
.It Va sources_conf
Location of the sources file. This file enables rsync synchronization of the default ports tree with the
MacPorts rsync server (through the "sync" target of the
.Nm port
command) and any other local tree(s) you might have.
.br
.Ic Default:
${prefix}/etc/macports/sources.conf
.It Va variants_conf
Location of the optional global variants definition file, listing those that should be used in all installed
ports if available.
.br
.Ic Default:
${prefix}/etc/macports/variants.conf
.It Va portarchivemode
Key governing the creation of binary archives of installed ports for installation/reinstallation ease.
.br
.Ic Default:
yes
.It Va portarchivepath
Location where to store/retrieve ports binary archive files from when archive mode is active.
.br
.Ic Default:
${portdbpath}/packages
.It Va portarchivetype
Colon or comma separated, space free list of supported formats of archives to create or read from when
\&'${archivemode}' is set to 'yes'. Use of multiple types will cause archive creation to build all the
specified types in one step. Unarchive uses multiple types as a search list to locate any existing archive,
with the first found match being used.
.br
Supported types are: tgz, tar, tbz, tbz2, tlz, txz, xar, zip, cpgz, cpio
.br
.Ic Default:
tgz
.It Va configureccache
Use ccache (C/C++ compiler cache). Requires that ccache has been installed.
.br
.Ic Default:
no
.It Va configuredistcc
Use distcc (distributed compiler). Requires that distcc has been installed.
.br
.Ic Default:
no
.It Va configurepipe
Use pipes rather than intermediate files when compiling C/C++/etc (gcc -pipe)
.br
.Ic Default:
no
.It Va buildnicevalue
Lowered scheduling priority (0-20) to use for make when building ports
.br
.Ic Default:
0
.It Va buildmakejobs
Number of simultaneous make jobs (commands) to use when building ports
.br
.Ic Default:
1
.It Va portautoclean
Automatic cleaning of the build directory of a given port after it has been installed.
.br
.Ic Default:
yes
.It Va keeplogs 
Keep logs for ports
.br
.Ic Default:
yes
.It Va build_arch
The machine architecture to try to build for in normal use
.br
Regular architectures include: ppc, i386, ppc64, x86_64
.br
.Ic Default (10.6):
x86_64 or i386 depending on hardware
.br
.Ic Default (10.5 and earlier):
i386 or ppc depending on hardware
.It Va universal_archs
The machine architectures to use for +universal variant
(multiple architecture entries should be space separated)
.br
Regular architectures include: ppc, i386, ppc64, x86_64
.br
.Ic Default (10.6):
x86_64 i386
.br
.Ic Default (10.5 and earlier):
i386 ppc
.It Va startupitem_type
Set the default type of startupitems to be generated, overridable by Portfiles that explicitly state a
startupitem.type key. If set to "default", then a type will be selected that's appropriate to the OS.
Supported types are: none, SystemStarter, launchd, default, rcNG.
.br
.Ic Default:
default
.It Va destroot_umask
Umask value to use during the destrooting or a port.
.br
.Ic Default:
022
.It Va rsync_server
Default rsync server to connect to when running "selfupdate" through the
.Nm port
command to update your entire MacPorts
installation (spanning both the MacPorts infrastructure and the ports tree).
.br
.Ic Default:
rsync.macports.org
.It Va rsync_dir
Rsync directory from which to pull MacPorts sources from the rsync server.
.br
.Ic Default:
release/base/ (which pulls sources for the currently shipping MacPorts release)
.It Va rsync_options
Default rsync options to use when connecting to the rsync server.
.br
.Ic Default:
-rtzv --delete-after
.It Va binpath
Sets the directory search path for locating system executables used by MacPorts. This variable should contain
the paths for locating utilities such as rsync, tar, cvs and others.
.br
.Ic Default:
${prefix}/bin:${prefix}/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
.It Va extra_env
List of extra environment variables MacPorts should keep in the user's environment when sanitizing it.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width
.It Va ${prefix}/etc/macports/macports.conf
Standard system-wide MacPorts configuration file.
.It Va ~/.macports/macports.conf
User-specific configuration override. This file, if found, will be used instead of the default file at
${prefix}/etc/macports/macports.conf.
