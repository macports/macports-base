NAME
----
port-platform - Print the OS version for which MacPorts was built

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-q*] *platform*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command prints the version of your operating system used to configure and
build MacPorts. This value is used to detect OS updates and refer users to the
wiki:Migration[] instructions.

Since MacPorts picks up a number of paths at configure-time and uses them later
on, changes in the operating system can break a MacPorts installation. For
example, this happened when Apple removed ``/usr/bin/gnutar'' with the release
of OS X Mavericks. Since MacPorts keeps the path to its tar command in a file,
this change required rebuilding MacPorts.
