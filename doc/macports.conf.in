# When to build ports from source. Default is 'ifneeded', which downloads an

# Type of archives to use for port images

# Supported types: tgz, tar, tbz, tbz2 (default), tlz, txz, xar, zip, cpgz, cpio

# CPU architecture to compile for. Defaults to i386 or ppc on Mac OS X 10.5

# Proxy support
# Precedence is: env, macports.conf, System Preferences
# That is, if it's set in the environment, that will be used instead of

# will cause any proxies set here (or in System Preferences if set there but
# not here) to override what's in the environment.
# Note that System Preferences doesn't have an rsync proxy definition.
# Also note that on 10.5 and later, sudo will clear many environment
# variables, including those for proxy support.
# Equivalent environment variables: http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, FTP_PROXY,

# Set whether to automatically run rev-upgrade after upgrading ports

#'rebuild' (default) or 'report'.

# When creating a pkg, specify the files and/or directories in
# ${prefix} to delete after the unarchive stage and before the
# pkg is created.  If not set, nothing is deleted.
#
# Because mpkg's are built from pkg's, any mpkg's will also have
# the specified files and/or directories omitted.
#
# For example
#
#   pkg_post_unarchive_deletions include share/doc share/man
#
# will delete ${prefix}/include, ${prefix}/share/doc and
# ${prefix}/share/man.
#
# This feature is useful when one wants to shrink the size of the
# pkg's and mpkg's for deployment to Macs that will not be used
# for development.  One large mpkg was observed to shrink from
# 504 MB to 271 MB.
#
#pkg_post_unarchive_deletions include share/doc share/man
