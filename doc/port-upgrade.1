.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBport upgrade\fR will upgrade the given installed ports to the latest available version\&. To upgrade a port, MacPorts needs an updated port definition, which can be obtained using the \fBport-selfupdate\fR(1) command\&. You should regularly run \fBselfupdate\fR followed by \fBupgrade outdated\fR to make sure your system has the latest versions and bug fixes\&.
.sp
When specifying variants during upgrade, the order of precedence is
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
variants specified on the command line
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
variants active in the latest installed version of the port

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\

variants specified in
\fBvariants.conf\fR(5)

In most cases, you should specify the \fBoutdated\fR pseudo\-port expression as argument to \fBport upgrade\fR to upgrade all ports where a newer version is available\&. This is the recommended upgrade method for end users\&. See \fBport\fR(1) for more information on pseudo\-port expressions\&. Upgrading individual packages should only be performed by expert users who know what they are doing, since a mix of upgraded and non\-upgraded packages can lead to various software errors\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-enforce\-variants\fR
.RS 4
Upgrade all given ports and their dependencies where the installed variants do not match those requested on the command line, even if those ports aren\(cqt outdated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-force\fR
.RS 4
Ignore circumstances that would normally cause ports to be skipped, such as not being outdated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-replace\fR
.RS 4
Do not automatically install ports that replace a now\-obsolete port you have installed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-rev\-upgrade\fR
.RS 4
Do not run rev\-upgrade after upgrading\&. See
\fBport-rev-upgrade\fR(1)
for more information\&.
.RE
.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.sp
Please see the section \fBGLOBAL OPTIONS\fR in the \fBport\fR(1) man page for a description of global port options\&.
.PP
\fB\-f\fR
.RS 4
Upgrade a port, even if it is not outdated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR
.RS 4
Only upgrade the given ports and avoid upgrading their dependencies\&. This flag may be useful when combined with
\fB\-\-enforce\-variants\fR\&.

WARNING: Ports expect their dependencies to always be at the latest version, which is why MacPorts upgrades dependencies first\&. Do not specify this flag if you don\(cqt know what you are doing\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR
.RS 4
Keep going and attempt to upgrade the next port when a port fails to build\&.

WARNING: This option is harmful to
\fBupgrade\fR
and should be avoided at all cost\&. Often, MacPorts ports are only upgraded to rebuild them against updated dependencies\&. Specifying this flag will cause a spurious rebuild if a dependency of a port fails to build and leave your system in a broken state once the dependent port is fixed\&.
