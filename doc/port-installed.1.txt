NAME
----
port-installed - List installed versions of a given port, or all installed ports

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-vq*] *installed*
     [['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port installed* can be used in two separate ways: Either without arguments, in
which case it will print a list of all installed ports (both active and
inactive), or with arguments, which will return a list of installed ports that
match the argument expression.

The output of *port installed* contains the name, version and variants of the
installed ports and whether the port is active or inactive. See the PORT IMAGES
section for an explanation of the active/inactive state.

*-v*::
    Print the platform at install time (i.e., your macOS version) and the
    architecture(s) of the installed port.

*-q*::
    Do not print the header line. This is useful when parsing the output of
    *port installed* in scripts for further processing.
