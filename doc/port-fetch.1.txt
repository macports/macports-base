NAME
----
port-fetch, port-checksum, port-extract, port-patch, port-configure, port-build, port-destroot, port-test - Run a specific phase of a port

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-vdoy*] [*-D* 'portdir'] [*fetch*  [--no-mirrors] | *checksum* | *extract* | *patch* | *configure* | *build* | *destroot* | *test* ]
     [['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
These commands run a specific phase of a port. Depending phases will be
executed automatically as needed.

If the 'Portfile' has changed between multiple invocation, *port* will perform
a clean before running the phase. The flag '-o' can be used to ignore this and
keep the current state of the ``work'' dir.

Note that the *test* phase is special in that it will not be run by MacPorts by
default. When supported by the given port, the *test* phase will run the
testcases of the software.

OPTIONS
-------
*--no-mirrors*::
    Only fetch files from URLs in master_sites
