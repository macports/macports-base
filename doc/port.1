.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.sp
\fBport\fR is designed to operate on individual or multiple \fIports\fR, optionally within a single call, based on the requested \fIaction\fR\&. If no \fIaction\fR is specified the port command enters shell mode, in which commands are read via stdin\&. If no \fIportdir\fR or \fIportname\fR is specified for an \fIaction\fR, the current working directory is assumed\&. Batch commands may be passed via a \fIcmdfile\fR\&. Port \fIoptions\fR are passed as key=value pairs and take precedence over individual \fIportname\fR options as specified in its Portfile and system\-wide settings\&.
.sp
Port \fIvariants\fR can be specified as \fI+name\fR, which indicates the variant is desired, or \fI\-name\fR, indicating the contrary\&. In case of ambiguities, a port can be fully specified with the \fI@version_revision+variants\fR format\&.
.sp
Installed ports can be activated or deactivated without being uninstalled\&. A port can be installed in multiple versions and variant combinations, but only one of them can be \fIactive\fR\&. See \fBportarchives\fR(7)\&.
.sp
When passing \fIportnames\fR to an \fIaction\fR, \fBport\fR recognizes various \fIpseudo\-portnames\fR that will expand to the specified set of ports from the available port tree(s)\&. These may be used in the same way as a \fIportname\fR\&.

Search strings that will expand to a set of matching ports can be constructed based on the "\fIpseudo\-portname selector\fR":regex combination used\&. \fIportnames\fR containing valid UNIX glob patterns will also expand to the set of matching ports\&.

Enable trace mode debug facilities on platforms that support it, currently only Mac OS X\&.

This feature is two\-folded\&. It consists in automatically detecting and reporting undeclared dependencies based on what files the port reads or what programs the port executes\&. In verbose mode, it will also report unused dependencies for each stage of the port installation\&. It also consists in forbidding and reporting file creation and file writes outside allowed directories (temporary directories and ${workpath})\&.

By selecting the variants to use in the upgraded build of the port, any variants specified on the command line take highest precedence, then the variants active in the latest installed version of the port, and finally the global variants specified in variants\&.conf, if any\&.

\fB\-\-enforce\-variants\fR, or deactivate the port and reinstall it with different variants\&.

After the upgrade MacPorts will automatically run rev\-upgrade to check for broken ports that need to be rebuilt\&. If there are known problems with rev\-upgrade or other reasons why you would want to avoid running this step, you can disable it by running port upgrade with the

rev\-upgrade
.RS 4



Manually check for broken binaries and rebuild ports containing broken binaries\&. rev\-upgrade is usually automatically run after each upgrade, unless you specify the
\fB\-\-no\-rev\-upgrade\fR
option\&.

rev\-upgrade can run more checks against a special loadcommand in Mach\-O binaries that should always be referencing the file itself\&. This check is most helpful for maintainers to check whether their ports have been built correctly\&. It is disabled by default and can be enabled by passing
\fB\-\-id\-loadcmd\-check\fR

\fB\-\-work\fR
\fIactionflag\fR\&. This is the default when no flag is given\&. To remove the distribution files (fetched tarballs, patches, etc), specify
\fB\-\-dist\fR\&. To remove any archive(s) of a port than remain in the temporary download directory, pass
\fB\-\-archive\fR\&. (This does not remove archives from the installed location\&.) To remove log files for a port, pass
\fB\-\-logs\fR\&. To remove the work files, distribution files, temporary archives and logs pass
\fB\-\-all\fR\&.
.sp

For example:

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
port clean \-\-dist vim
port clean \-\-archive vim
port clean \-\-logs vim
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp

To remove only certain version(s) of a port\(cqs archives (version is any valid UNIX glob pattern), you can use:

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
port clean \-\-archive vim 6\&.2\&.114
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp

or:

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
port clean \-\-archive vim \*(Aq6\&.*\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp

.RE
.PP
log
.RS 4



Parses and shows log files for
\fIportname\fR\&. To filter log files by some criterions use
\fB\-\-phase\fR
to specify the phase you want to show and
\fB\-\-verbosity\fR
to specify message category (msg, info, debug)\&.
.sp

For example:

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
port log \-\-phase configure vim
port log \-\-phase fetch \-\-verbosity debug vim
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp

.RE
.PP
logfile
.RS 4



Displays the path to the log file for
\fIportname\fR\&.

.RE
.PP
echo
.RS 4



Writes to stdout the arguments passed to
\fIport\fR\&. This follows the expansion of
\fIpseudo\-portnames\fR, portname glob patterns,
\fIpseudo\-portname selectors\fR
and the evaluation of
\fIport\-expressions\fR\&.
\fBecho\fR
may be used to determine the exact set of ports to which a given string of arguments will expand, without performing any further operations on them\&.
.sp

For example:

.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
port echo category:net
port echo maintainer:jmpp and name:netw
port echo maintainer:jmpp and \e( net* or category:text \e)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp

.RE
.PP
list
.RS 4



If no argument is given, display a list of the latest version of all available ports\&. If portname(s) are given as arguments, display a list of the latest version of each port\&.

.RE
.PP
mirror
.RS 4



Create/update a local mirror of distfiles used for ports given on the command line\&. The filemap database can be reset by using the
\fB\-\-new\fR
option (though if no database is found, it will be created automatically)\&. If the fetched file does not match the checksum given in the Portfile, it is deleted\&. This can be used with
\fIpseudo\-portnames\fR, e\&.g\&.
\fIall\fR, to mirror everything\&. Note that if you use
\fIall\fR, you\(cqll most likely want to use
\fB\-p\fR
so
\fBport\fR
doesn\(cqt quit on the first download failure\&.

.RE
.PP
version
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
selfupdate
.RS 4

.nf
sudo port selfupdate
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp

See
\fIsync\fR
for more information about updating ports tree(s)\&.

.RE
.PP
load
.RS 4
