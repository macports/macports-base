# This is a partial list of items to be completed, or considered, for future
# revisions.

Version 1.2:

	(these may make it into 1.2)
    - Add to port(1) manpage docs for new port(1) syntax. (Juan & documentation team, hopefully ;-)
    - Add to portfile(7) manpage docs for the new startupitem keys. (idem)
    	(James added some suggested text to bug #4905)
    - Add to ports.conf(5) manpage docs on new startupitem_type option. (idem)
    	(James added some suggested text to bug #4905)
    - Portfile(7) missing keywords: http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4905 (idem)
    - Bug http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5220 (Juan)
    	(install from CVS or tarfile doesn't build dports directory and portindex)
    - Maybe: cvs/svn fetch w/ patches: http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5269 (yeled?)

Version 1.3:

	- Consider recognizing ports by directory name in port if the element contains
	  a / but doesn't look like a url. Such a name could be transformed immediately
	  into a url.
	  
	- Consider allowing multiple actions per port invocation, either read from
	  standard input as lines, or separated on the command line by something like ';'.
	  This would allow one to amortize port load time if multiple actions are desired,
	  particularly from other scripts.
	  
	- Consider changing dportopen so that it doesn't change the current directory. Does
	  this get used anywhere? It certainly complicates our handling of relative urls/
	  directories.
