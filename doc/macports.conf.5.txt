NAME
----
macports.conf - Configuration file of the MacPorts system

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*macports.conf* is the configuration file used to bootstrap the MacPorts
system. This file is read by the *port* command and determines how it behaves.
Lines beginning with '#' are comments, empty lines are ignored. The format is
that of a simple key/value space or tab separated pair.

The file contains entries of the form:
--------
<key> <value>
--------

The value of any given key can be referred to by the '$\{<keyname>\}'
abstraction, where '<keyname>' expands to the key in question.

KEYS
----
// Set default style for second-level labeled lists in this section
:listdef-labeled2.style: horizontal

The following keys are used by *port* itself:

prefix::
    Sets the directory where ports are installed. Any path may be used but those
    with spaces and/or non ascii characters should be avoided, as this can break
    some ports. This key is often referred to as '$\{prefix\}'.
    *Default:*;; /opt/local

portdbpath::
    Directory where MacPorts keeps working data such as downloaded sources,
    installed ports' receipts and the main registry. The same path restrictions
    apply as for '$\{prefix\}'.
    *Default:*;; $\{prefix\}/var/macports

portdbformat::
    Storage type to use for the MacPorts registry. The preferred format is
    "sqlite", with "flat" also available as a legacy format.
    *Default:*;; sqlite

applications_dir::
    Directory containing Applications installed from ports.
    *Default:*;; /Applications/MacPorts

frameworks_dir::
    Directory containing Frameworks installed from ports.
    *Default:*;; $\{prefix\}/Library/Frameworks

sources_conf::
    Location of the sources file. This file enables rsync synchronization of the
    default ports tree with the MacPorts rsync server (through the "sync" target
    of the port command) and any other local tree(s) you might have.
    *Default:*;; $\{prefix\}/etc/macports/sources.conf

variants_conf::
    Location of the optional global variants definition file, listing those that
    should be used in all installed ports if available.
    *Default:*;; $\{prefix\}/etc/macports/variants.conf

buildfromsource::
    Controls whether ports are built from source or downloaded as pre-built
    archives. Setting to 'always' will never use archives, 'never' will always
    try to use an archive and fail if one is not available. 'ifneeded' will try
    to fetch an archive and fall back to building from source if that isn't
    possible.
    *Default:*;; ifneeded

portarchivetype::
    Format of archives in which to store port images. This controls the
    type of archive created locally after building from source, but not the
    type to request from remote servers (that is controlled by
    'archive_sites.conf'). Changing this will not affect the usability of
    already installed archives; they can be of any supported type.
    *Supported types:*;; tgz, tar, tbz, tbz2, tlz, txz, xar, zip, cpgz, cpio
    *Default:*;; tbz2

configureccache::
    Use ccache (C/C++ compiler cache). Requires that ccache has been installed.
    *Default:*;; no

ccache_dir::
    Location where ccache stores its files
    *Default:*;; $\{portdbpath\}/build/.ccache

ccache_size::
    Maximum size ccache may use. Use 'G', 'M', or 'K' suffix for giga-, mega- or
    kilobytes.
    *Default:*;; 2G

configuredistcc::
    Use distcc (distributed compiler). Requires that distcc has been installed.
    *Default:*;; no

configurepipe::
    Use pipes rather than intermediate files when compiling C/C++/etc (gcc
    -pipe)
    *Default:*;; yes

buildnicevalue::
    Lowered scheduling priority (0-20) to use for make when building ports
    *Default:*;; 0

buildmakejobs::
    Number of simultaneous make jobs (commands) to use when building ports. 0 is
    a special value meaning "the number of CPU cores or the number of GB of
    physical memory plus one, whichever is less."
    *Default:*;; 0

portautoclean::
    Automatic cleaning of the build directory of a given port after it has been
    installed.
    *Default:*;; yes

keeplogs::
    Keep logs for ports.
    *Default:*;; no

build_arch::
    The machine architecture to try to build for in normal use.
    *Regular architectures include:*;; ppc, i386, ppc64, x86_64, arm64
    *Default (11 and later):*;; arm64 or x86_64 depending on hardware
    *Default (10.6-10.15):*;; x86_64 or i386 depending on hardware
    *Default (10.5 and earlier):*;; i386 or ppc depending on hardware

universal_archs::
    The machine architectures to use for +universal variant (multiple
    architecture entries should be space separated). Should contain at
    least two entries, or be empty to disable universal building.
    *Regular architectures include:*;; ppc, i386, ppc64, x86_64, arm64
    *Default (11 and later):*;; arm64 x86_64
    *Default (10.6-10.13):*;; x86_64 i386
    *Default (10.5 and earlier):*;; i386 ppc

startupitem_type::
    Set the default type of startupitems to be generated, overridable by
    Portfiles that explicitly state a startupitem.type key. If set to "default",
    then a type will be selected that's appropriate to the OS.
    *Supported types:*;; none, launchd, default.
    *Default:*;; default

startupitem_install::
    Create system-level symlinks to generated StartupItems. If set to
    "no", symlinks will not be created; otherwise, symlinks will be placed
    in /Library/LaunchDaemons or /Library/LaunchAgents as appropriate.
    This setting only applies when building ports from source.
    *Default:*;; yes

destroot_umask::
    Umask value to use during the destrooting of a port.
    *Default:*;; 022

rsync_server::
    Default rsync server to connect to when running "selfupdate" through the
    port com- mand to update your base MacPorts infrastructure. While selfupdate
    also syncs the ports tree, it uses the settings from $\{sources_conf\} to do
    so.
    *Default:*;; rsync.macports.org

rsync_dir::
    Rsync directory from which to pull MacPorts sources from the rsync server.
    *Default:*;; macports/release/base/ (which pulls sources for the currently shipping
    MacPorts release)

rsync_options::
    Default rsync options to use when connecting to the rsync server.
    *Default:*;; -rtzvl --delete-after

binpath::
    Sets the directory search path for locating system executables used by
    MacPorts. This variable should contain the paths for locating utilities such
    as rsync, tar, cvs and others. Don't change this unless you understand and
    accept the consequences.
    *Default:*;; $\{prefix\}/bin:$\{prefix\}/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin

extra_env::
    List of extra environment variables MacPorts should keep in the user's
    environment when sanitizing it. Changing this is unsupported.

proxy_override_env::
    Proxy support. Precedence is: env, macports.conf, System Preferences. That
    is, if it's set in the environment, that will be used instead of anything
    here or in System Preferences. Setting proxy_override_env to yes will cause
    any proxies set here (or in System Preferences if set there but not here) to
    override what's in the environment. Note that System Preferences doesn't
    have an rsync proxy definition. Also note, on 10.5, sudo will clear many
    environment variables including those for proxy support. Equivalent
    environment variables: http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, FTP_PROXY, RSYNC_PROXY,
    NO_PROXY
    *Default:*;; yes

proxy_http::
    HTTP proxy
    *Default:*;; none

proxy_https::
    HTTPS proxy
    *Default:*;; none

proxy_ftp::
    FTP proxy
    *Default:*;; none

proxy_rsync::
    rsync proxy
    *Default:*;; none

proxy_skip::
    Hosts not to go through the proxy (comma-separated, applies to HTTP, HTTPS
    and FTP, but not rsync).
    *Default:*;; none

host_blacklist::
    Space separated list of glob patterns. Any download host matching one of
    these patterns will not be used.
    *Default:*;; none

preferred_hosts::
    Space separated list of glob patterns. Any download host matching one of
    these patterns will be preferred.
    *Default:*;; none

revupgrade_autorun::
    Controls whether the rev-upgrade action will be run automatically after
    upgrading ports.
    *Default:*;; yes

revupgrade_mode::
    Controls the rev-upgrade functionality which checks for broken linking and
    can rebuild ports to fix it. 'rebuild' means ports will automatically be
    rebuilt when broken linking is detected in their files, while 'report' means
    broken files will be scanned for and reported but the ports will not be
    rebuilt.
    *Default:*;; rebuild

default_compilers::
    Default value for configure.compiler. This can be a space-separated list.
    Later entries will be used if earlier entries are unavailable or blacklisted
    by a port. Setting this is unsupported.
    *Default:*;; none (internal list based on Xcode version is normally used)
