This test checks for case-insensitive port names. From Portfile.in it
generates a Portfile which is installed with a lowercase name (casesensitive)
and uninstalled with a CamelCase name (CaseSensitivE). The install/uninstall
is verified by the existance/absence of the '/tmp/macports-tests/opt/local/var/test/case'
file.

There are 2 test cases. One to install a port and the other to uninstall.
