# Port Images are basically just installations of the destroot of a port into
# ${macports::registry.path}/software/${name}/${version}_${revision}${variants}
# They allow the user to install multiple versions of the same port, treating
# each revision and each different combination of variants as a "version".
#
# From there, the user can "activate" a port image.  This creates {sym,hard}links for
# all files in the image into the ${prefix}.  Directories are created.
# Activation checks the registry's file_map for any files which conflict with
# other "active" ports, and will not overwrite the links to the those files.
# The conflicting port must be deactivated first.
#
# The user can also "deactivate" an active port.  This will remove all {sym,hard}links
# from ${prefix}, and if any directories are empty, remove them as well.  It
# will also remove all of the references of the files from the registry's
# file_map
#
# For the creating and removing of links during activation and deactivation,
# code very similar to what is used in portinstall is used.
