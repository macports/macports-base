/**
 * A native command to handle filemaps.
 * filemaps are dictionaries (what Tcl calls arrays) with case unsensitive keys
 * that are file paths and values that are port names.
 * This object is not thread safe (i.e. calls are not synchronous).
 * Get/Set/Unset operations depend on the number of elements in each directory,
 * they are nevertheless very fast.
 * List is a O(n) operation (the slow operation).
 *
 * The syntax is:
 * filemap create filemapVarName
 *	Create a r/w filemap in RAM. This map will not be saved to disk.
 *
 * filemap open filemapVarName filemapPath [readonly]
 *	open or create filemap database at filemapPath and put the handle to access
 *	it in variable filemapVarName.
 *	If permissions permit it, the database is open r/w (actually, the lock
 *	is open r/w). Otherwise, or if readonly is specified, the database is open
 *	read only.
 *
 * filemap close filemapVarName
 *	close and save filemap database.
 *
 * filemap exists filemapVarName path
 *	test if a given path exists in the database.
 *
 * filemap get filemapVarName path
 *	return the value associated with a given path in the database.
 *	return an error if the key is not in the database.
 *
 * filemap isreadonly filemapVarName
 *	determine if the filemap is read/only.
 *
 * filemap list filemapVarName value
 *	return a list of all the keys that match with this value.
 *  comparison is case sensitive.
 *
 * filemap revert filemapVarName
 *	revert the filemap to the previous version saved on disk (or reload it
 *	if another process modified it, if the database was open read only of
 *	course).
 *
 * filemap save filemapVarName
 *	save the filemap to disk (without closing it)
 *
 * filemap set filemapVarName path value
 *	set a key,value pair in the database.
 *
 * filemap unset filemapVarName path
 *	remove a key,value pair from the database.
