      prefix contained a symlink. (#39850, cal in r113704)

    - Disable Spotlight indexing on build directories, distfiles,
      registry, log files, archives, base source and the default ports
      tree. (cal in r113649)

    - Support syncing git-svn working copies. (jeremyhu in r109747)

    - Remove support for mports:// and non-tarball HTTP/FTP port tree sources.

    - Fixed a problem where dependency calculation could sometimes fail for
      ports that only support 32-bit architectures when the configured

    - Add 'port space --total' which displays the grand total only.
      (raimue in r102248)

    - Added 'subport:' pseudo-portname that expands to ports that provide

    - Added ability to sync ports tree with git (jeremyhu in r92410)

Release 2.1.3 (2013-01-31 by jmr)
    - Fixed a bug where a certain order of starting and aborting a build,
      running selfupdate and continuing a build would resume building although
      it should start from the beginning.
      (#29223, cal in r96136, r96399, r96400, r96538)

    - Fix permission problem in the creation of the ccache directory with
      ccache >= 3.1.7 by running the initialization step as the macportsuser.
      (raimue in r97868)

    - Fix an endless loop that could be triggered in rev-upgrade when a broken

      (cal in r100129, jmr in r101313)

    - Set a busy timeout on SQLite connections to prevent MacPorts from
      uselessly burning CPU cycles when waiting for a database lock.
      (cal in r100217)

    - Switch from exclusive locking to immediate locking in the registry
      database to avoid locking reads where not needed.
      (cal in r100218)

      macports-clang-3.1, macports-gcc-4.7, macports-gcc-4.8
      (jeremyhu in r86719, ryandesign in r91521)

    - Avoid using pkg-config to find sqlite3 in our configure script unless it
      can't be found by other means, because some third-party packages
      incorrectly install a /usr/bin/pkg-config that points to an incompatible
      copy of sqlite3. (#30932, dluke/jmr in r91512)

    - 'port pkg' and 'port mpkg' will now create flat packages (i.e. a xar
      archive rather than a directory) on 10.6+.
      (jmr in r91317, r91329, r91331, r91437)

    - Fixed dependencies sometimes being installed multiple times when
      required with different archs. (#31794, jmr in r91357)

      (jmr in r91196, r91217)

    - Added new config file archive_sites.conf, which can be used to configure
      additional archive download sources. Each source has an associated
      archive type; portarchivetype is now only used when creating archives
      locally. Sources also have an associated prefix, applications_dir and
      frameworks_dir, and if any of these do not match the current values, the
      source is not used. (jmr in r91009)

    - Xcode 4.3 support: Search harder for developer directory; advise user to
      run xcode-select when necessary, searching for Xcode and suggesting
      xcode-select commands.
      (jberry, jmr in r89970,r89971,r89972,r89996,r89999,r90003,r90005-r90009,

    - warn about non-existing developer_dir when it's set in macports.conf
      (cal in 90802)

      port sets build.type bsd (#33355, cal in r90650)

    - Added -W option for reinplace that sets a base directory that all file
      arguments are interpreted as being relative to. (raimue in r90610)

    - Added macports.conf options 'host_blacklist' and 'preferred_hosts', used
      for indicating lists of download hosts that should not be used or should
      be used preferentially, respectively. These override the usual ping time
      check. Ping times are also now cached for 24 hours. (jmr in r89459)

    - Added 'rev-upgrade' action checking for broken linkage and rebuilding
      ports containing broken files. Made rev-upgrade run automatically after
      each upgrade or install.
      (cal in branch gsoc11-rev-upgrade, merge in r88376, also cal, raimue, jmr
      in r88377,r88411,r88441,r88511,r88666,r88732,r89180,r89659,r89661,r90102,
      r90381)

    - Added options controlling rev-upgrade behavior to macports.conf
      (jmr, cal in r88725,r88794,r89189)

    - port livecheck regex finds multiple matches on the same line
      (raimue in r88031)

    - Several improvements to port lint:
      licenses, subversion properties, maintainer addresses
      (#30194, snc, raimue in r85929, r86016, r89428, r89610)

    - Added license_noconflict option to specify dependencies for which the
      maintainer has manually checked license compatibility and wishes to
      overrule the conservative automated checks. (jmr in r89004)

    - Xcode 4.3 support: Use xcrun -find to find xcode compiler if it's not
      found in /usr/bin.
      (jberry, jmr in r88540,r88541,r88546,r88777,r88779,r88787,r89359,r89984,r90028)

    - Added options compiler.blacklist, compiler.whitelist, and
      compiler.fallback; to allow blacklisting, whitelisting, and setting the
      fallback order for configure.compiler values, respectively.
      (#30041, jmr in r88676)

    - Fix sync with subdirectory of Subversion 1.7-format working copy
      (#33573, jmr in 86872)

    - Fixed conflicts not being checked for when installing ports that have no
      dependencies. (#31571, dports in r85382)

    - The deprecated Portfile options svn.tag, distcheck.check and
      livecheck.check have been removed. (raimue in r82763)

    - Implement new option-replace using lsearch/lreplace. The old behavior is
      deprecated for option-replace with only one argument, but can still be
      found in option-strsed.
      (raimue in r82760, r82761)

    - Added 'buildfromsource' macports.conf setting, which allows permanently
      selecting the behaviour of the -s or -b option. (jmr in r81540)

Release 2.0.4 (2012-02-25 by jmr)
    - Added -locale option for reinplace (jeremyhu in r89839)

    - Xcode 4.3 support: Change home directory for MacPorts user to
      ${prefix}/var/macports/home.
      (jberry, jmr in r89988, r89993, r90002, r90010, r90011)

    - set env(HOME) to ${workpath}/.home when building ports
      (#31827, jmr in r89994, r90004)

    - Fix use_xmkmf to honor xmkmf.env for its make Makefiles phase
      (#31504, jeremyhu in r89537, r89538, r89539)

    - Added configure.cxx setting when configure.compiler is apple-gcc-4.2
      (jeremyhu in r80248)

    - Xcode 4.3 support: added packagemaker_path macports.conf setting
      (jmr in r90058)

    - Resolve ambiguity in selection in portlists
      (jberry in r88179, r88185)

    - Xcode 4.3 support: updated default developer_dir location for 4.3
      (jmr in r90016)

    - Xcode 4.3 support: use compilers in /usr/bin instead of developer_dir
      when possible, as the latter has proven to be volatile.
      (jmr in r90015)

    - Xcode 4.3 support: updated SDK paths for 4.3 (jmr in r90000)

    - Work around broken FTP proxy support in some versions of libcurl
      (jmr in r84351, r88045)

Release 2.0.3 (2011-09-05 by raimue)
    - Fix a regression introduced in 2.0.2 when fetching with a VCS
      (#31073, jmr in r83471)

Release 2.0.2 (2011-09-01 by jmr):
    - Messages recommending running selfupdate will no longer be printed when
      selfupdate is being run. (#23094, jmr in r83270, r83391)

    - The PortIndex will not be regenerated during selfupdate when base is
      outdated. This avoids failure to index ports that use features only
      available in the current version. (#30739, jmr in r83271)

    - Fixed build failures when the TMPDIR environment variable is set to a
      directory that is not writable by the macports user.
      (#30749, jmr in r83267)

    - Fixed error when checksumming distfiles with names containing spaces.
      (#28568, jmr in r83149)

    - The uninstall and deactivate actions now sort the port list so that
      dependents are processed before the ports they depend on.
      (#8431, jmr in r82947)

    - Fixed an issue where a non-universal version of a port could be
      installed as a dependency as well as the universal version, with
      unpredictable results, when some ports in the dependency graph needed
      the universal version but others didn't. (jmr in r82924)

    - Now using a temp dir inside ${prefix} when activating, as /tmp or
      /var/folders may be on a different volume. (jmr in r82767)

    - Fixed extracting portfile-only archives. (#31033, jmr in r81830)

    - Fixed adduser and addgroup procedures not re-dropping privileges when
      done. (jmr in r81630)

    - Fixed error activating ports with names containing the string "cpio".
      (#30532, jmr in r81577)

Release 2.0.1 (2011-08-02 by jmr):
    - Fixed errors when installing some archives built on a case-sensitive
      filesystem onto a case-insensitive one. (#30373, jmr in r81562)

    - Fixed users created by MacPorts showing up in the GUI in some places on
      Lion. (#30168, jeremyhu in r81558)

    - Added replaced_by pseudo-portname selector. (afb in r81475)

    - Added progress output to port image conversion script.
      (#30347, jmr in r81464)

    - Now doing a better job of avoiding UID conflicts with non-local users
      when creating the 'macports' user. (#30464, jmr in r81414, r81415) Also
      improved Tiger compatibility in this area. (jmr in r81454, r81467)

    - Fixed 'port selfupdate' exiting with non-zero status after installing a
      new version of base. (jmr in r81371)

    - Added --subports to options accepted by 'port info'. (jmr in r81234)

    - Fixed incorrect info sometimes being added to PortIndex entries when
      using subports. (#30463, jmr in r81361)

    - Fixed descriptions not being shown for default variants. (jmr in r80971)

    - Fixed 'port variants --index'. (jmr in r80969)

Release 2.0.0 (2011-07-22 by jmr):

    - Multiple ports can now be defined in one Portfile using the 'subport'
      procedure. This reduces code duplication when several ports use very
      similar code. (jmr in r78062)

    - Privilege dropping is now on by default. The runtime user can be changed
      when building from source but defaults to 'macports'; this user is
      created at install time. (jmr in r79025)

    - Fetching from some extremely slow or partially unresponsive servers
      should now time out as expected. (raimue in r71038)

    - The registry is now "vacuumed" (compacted/defragmented) after
      uninstalling ports. (jmr in r70608)

    - Downloaded archives are now checked for integrity using digital
      signatures. Sync and selfupdate can also use a signed tarball. New
      pubkeys.conf file allows configuring keys to trust.
      (jmr in r68996, r79093)

    - Added 'actinact' pseudo-portname that expands to installed ports with an
      active version and at least one inactive version.
      (#27666, jmr in r79421, based on patch from gmail.com:ww.galen)

    - Added --size option for 'contents' action that makes it print the size
      of each file. (#27245, jmr in r79365, based on patch from
      gmail.com:ww.galen)

    - Added 'space' action to show the disk space used by ports' active files.
      (#27244, jmr in r79349, based on patch from gmail.com:ww.galen)

    - Actions can be abbreviated to an unambiguous prefix of the full name.
      (#27242, patch from gmail.com:ww.galen committed in r79259)

    - Fixed error when activating ports whose version contains an underscore
      followed by an integer and a dash. (#28084, jmr in r79167)

    - Deactivating a port that has dependents no longer needs to be forced
      when the dependents are all inactive. (#29505, jmr in r78086)

    - New option 'add_users' has been added. Setting it will ensure that the
      listed users are created before all operations that may require them to
      exist. (#11563, jmr in r78660)

    - 'port info --index' should be much faster and will work with the
      'current' pseudo-port provided the port has been indexed.
      (#13673, jmr in r78621)

    - Relocation is explicitly disabled when building pkgs on 10.6, so Apple's
      Installer won't attempt to overwrite other copies of the same software
      not installed by MacPorts. (#25174, jmr in r78178)

    - Non-Darwin platforms can once again build base against OpenSSL for
      checksum support. (#26813, afb in r77865)

    - It is now safe to set svn.post_args, rather than that option being
      reserved for svn.url. (#27454, jmr in r73825)

    - Variants specified when running 'port mpkg' are now set in the
      dependencies as well. (#27231, jmr in r73303)

    - Fixed various issues with privilege dropping.
      (#26899, jmr in r69453 etc.)

    - Trace mode no longer fails on 10.6. (#21582, jmr in r74318, r74369)

    - Ports that create StartupItems (aka launchd plists) should now be
      installable by unprivileged users. (#10879, jmr in r66700, r75143)

    - Fixed incorrect output from 'port dependents' when using newer SQLite
      versions. (#27506, patch from gmail.com:mmpestorich committed in r76827)

    - The flat registry format is no longer available. Setting portdbformat to
      'flat' in macports.conf will result in the sqlite registry being used.
      (jmr in r77681)

    - Port images are now stored as archives. Archive mode is now effectively
      always on. Among other benefits, this fixes some bugs with the handling
      of hard links installed by ports (e.g. #13601).

      Direct mode is no longer available. Existing port image directories, and
      installed files for direct mode, will be converted to archives when
      upgrading.

      (#19458, branch by blb, merged by jmr in r77511)

    - master_site_local, patch_site_local, and archive_site_local can be set
      in macports.conf, with the same effects as the corresponding environment
      variables. (jmr in r74924)

    - Added 'logfile' action that prints the path to a port's log file.
      (jmr in r74655)

    - Computing large dependency trees that contain the same port(s) multiple
      times should be considerably faster. (jmr in r73133)

    - New configure.compiler options: macports-gcc-4.6, macports-llvm-gcc-4.2,
      macports-clang (jmr in r71487; mfeiri in r72936, r72937)

    - Add '-n' option to reinplace (#26406, ryandesign in r73227)

    - Add new ccache_dir and ccache_size options, default path is
      ${portdbpath}/build/.ccache and a size of 2 GB.
      (raimue in r71604, r71606)

    - Add 'system -W path' which changes to the given directory before
      executing the command.
      (raimue in r71380, r71389)

    - Add -w to build.cmd and destroot.cmd if using gnumake
      (raimue in r71370)

    - Add livecheck.ignore_sslcert; setting fetch.ignore_sslcert does no
      longer apply to livecheck. distcheck now respects fetch.ignore_sslcert.
      (#17063, raimue in r70975, r70979, r70982)

    - Add SHA256 checksums in addition to MD5, SHA1 and RIPEMD160.
      (afb in r57888, r57913; snc in r68955)

    - Add @pkgdep lines to archives, with build-time dependencies.
      (afb in r76919)

Release 1.9.2 (2010-11-07 by jmr):

    - Added more locking to avoid TOCTOU errors when running multiple port(1)
      instances (#19935, jmr in r70174)

    - Fixed -q not suppressing output from 'port lint' (#25880, jmr in r70163)

    - Added a helpful message when there is a checksum mismatch and the
      distfile appears to incorrectly be a HTML document (#25128,
      ryandesign/jmr in r70143)

    - Now checking early on if there are sufficient privileges to install,
      and failing before building anything if not (#25671, jmr in r70135)

    - Avoided possible failure when the -u option is used when upgrading a
      port that is marked as being replaced by another (jmr in r69022)

    - Using the platform-specific PortIndex when syncing using a daily tarball
      (jmr in r68786)

    - Fixed failures when fetch target is run without root privileges and the
      port is then installed with them (#25418, #25937; jmr in r69334, r70271)

    - Fixed upgrading ports where the new version differs from the old version
      only in epoch (jmr in r69436)

    - Fixed [un]setrequested when using the flat registry format
      (#26352, jmr in r69387)

    - Fixed checking for conflicting ports before installation
      (#25386, jmr in r69105)

    - Now gracefully handling distfiles that use a tag that is not
      associated with any sites (#25332, jmr in r68965)

    - Fixed running 'port deps' on multiple ports, and changed its output
      format back to how it was in 1.8 (#25324, jmr in r68950)

    - Fixed premature privilege dropping (#25331, jmr in r68952)

Release 1.9.1 (2010-06-18 by jmr):
    - Fixed a couple of problems with new 1.9 features when using the flat
      registry format (jmr in r68910, r68913)

    - Ports using the replaced_by option will once again be deactivated when
      an upgrade is performed on them (#25270, jmr in r68872)

    - Fixed the possibility of some empty directories being left behind when
      a port is deactivated (#25268, jmr in r68864)

    - Fixed failure to detect conflicts with files that are not provided by
      a port before activation starts (#25255, jmr in r68849)

    - Fixed problems with distfile names containing spaces (#25245, #25246;
      jmr in r68816, r68817)

    - Fixed a problem with uninstall when using direct mode, and started
      running pre/post activate and deactivate procedures when installing and
      uninstalling in direct mode, respectively (#11562, jmr in r68697)

    - fixed a crasher that affected Tiger (#25194, jmr in r68675, r68680,
      r68691)

Release 1.9.0 (2010-06-08 by jmr):

    - It is no longer possible to use include statements in Portfiles
      (raimue in r68206)

    - Command line options can be abbreviated if unambiguous
      (raimue in r66837)

    - Added a new variable 'os.subplatform'. When os.platform is darwin, the
      subplatform is either 'macosx' or 'puredarwin'.

    - 'platform' no longer creates a variant, instead it executes the code in
      the body immediately if the current platform matches the one specified.

    - Using a Portfile with a modification date in the future now causes an
      informative error early on, instead of just discarding the workdir at
      the start of every phase. (#24717, raimue in r65246)

    - Fetching from servers that require a cookie to be set now works.
      (#24584, raimue in r66785)

    - Fixed an error when everything is deleted from the patchfiles list.
      (#24178, raimue in r65243)

    - Added 'license:' pseudo-port selector. (#24123, perry in r65033)

    - Added new fetch.type 'bzr'. (#23436, perry in r65096)

    - Added 'rdeps' and 'rdependents' actions, recursive versions of 'deps'
      and 'dependents' respectively. Also added 'depof:', 'rdepof:',
      'dependentof:' and 'rdependentof:' pseudo-port selectors, for specifying
      the ports that are dependencies or dependents of the given port.
      (#22346, jmr in r65858/r66198)

    - Updated the description of the search action in the port(1) man page.
      (#23749, jmr in r66670)

    - Dry-run now uses /dev/null as the statefile, which prevents a couple of
      problems involving locking and variant checks.
      (#21794, #21962; jmr in r66921)

    - The list of dependencies to be installed is now displayed immediately
      after computing them. (#21540, jmr in r66321)

    - The quick index is now reloaded after syncing in interactive mode, which
      prevents errors due to it not matching the updated PortIndex.
      (#20874, jmr in r66319, refinement of patch from carrel.org:edward)

    - The architectures of dependencies are checked when installing a port. If
      a dependency does not provide the required arch(s), it is rebuilt with
      +universal if that is possible and will help, otherwise the install fails
      and an error message explains why. (#20728, jmr in r65087)

    - New supported_archs option allows ports to indicate which architectures
      they can be built for. The default values of configure.build_arch and
      configure.universal_archs change based on this list. Set this to
      'noarch' if a port installs only architecture-independent files.
      (#20739, jmr in r64372/r64945)

    - Declaring a variant that requires one or more other variants will now
      correctly set the required variants, so they can be checked with
      variant_isset. (#19224, jmr in r66642)

    - 'port outdated' now indicates the reason why a port that appears to have
      the same version as that in the tree is considered outdated. Possible
      reasons are that the epoch is higher, or the installed version was built
      on a different OS version. (#19138, jmr in r64960)

    - Distfile names are now percent-escaped in the download URLs when needed.
      (#18736, jmr in r66794)

    - buildnicevalue is now applied to configure and destroot commands, and to
      build commands with unusual names. (#18304, raimue in r65076/r65808)

    - Removed hardcoded /opt/local prefix from the base dmg resources.
      (#17633, jmr in r66776)

    - Fixed an error that occurred when archive mode was enabled but
      ${prefix}/var/macports/packages did not exist. (#17579, jmr in r66775)

    - Syncing rsync sources now tries to get a platform-specific version of
      the PortIndex from the server, and skips this if the local copy is less
      than a day old. All sync methods now update the PortIndex at the end.
      (#17157, jmr in r66846/r67207)

    - portindex(1) now skips parsing Portfiles whose modification time is
      older than the current PortIndex, instead reusing the existing entry.
      (#16235, jmr in r66845)

    - Added a 'requested' flag to the registry that indicates which ports were
      installed explicitly (as opposed to as a dependency of something else).
      This enables the new 'requested', 'unrequested' and 'leaves' pseudo-
      ports, as well as the --follow-dependencies option for uninstall.
      The setrequested and unsetrequested actions will set and clear the flag,
      respectively.
      (#15260, jmr in r64517, r64663, r65546, r66037, r66200, r66215)

    - The macports1.0 directory is now installed to
      ${prefix}/share/macports/Tcl rather than /Library/Tcl. A symlink will be
      installed in the old location if there is nothing there already, so
      'package require macports' will still work in tclsh.
      (#12943, jmr in r65055)

    - Added warning and error messags when Xcode is old enough to cause
      problems or too old to use at all, respectively. (#12794, jmr in r66771)

    - Removed the rather outdated copy of sqlite3 from the source tree, made
      the sqlite3 directory configurable, and added defaults for non-darwin
      platforms. (#12231, jmr in r64358/r64363)

    - There is a new 'archivefetch' target which is run before unarchive when
      archive mode is enabled, and attempts to download the archive from a
      server. There are currently no sites configured to download from (these
      are stored in the ports tree like the mirror sites used for fetch), but
      you can set ARCHIVE_SITE_LOCAL in the environment. Note that there is no
      integrity checking for archives yet. (#8571, jmr in r64816)

    - Now recording negative variants in the registry, which stops deselected
      variants from being reactivated on upgrade due to default_variants or
      variants.conf settings. (#2377, jmr in r64533)

    - Added support for pre- and post- procedures for the activate, deactivate
      and uninstall targets. This feature requires portdbformat sqlite. There
      was limited support for pre- and post-activate previously, but the
      procedures were only run when installing the port, not when activating
      an inactive version. (#1068, #4228, #18273; jmr in r64638/r64639)

    - Integrated the sqlite-based registry2.0 code. The portdbformat variable
      in macports.conf can be set to 'sqlite' to enable it. Existing flat
      receipts will be converted the first time port(1) is run with sufficient
      privileges. Original code by sfiera, fixed and integrated by jmr in
      r63398 and following. The new format lacks a number of problems that the
      old one suffers from, including #13054 (dependencies from old port
      versions stick around across upgrades) and #14123 (files whose paths
      differ only in case are left behind when uninstalling).

    - Fixed file list in +CONTENTS file in archives. (#21864, jmr in r59882)

    - Fixed a few issues reported with building MacPorts on Linux. (#22716)

    - Upgrade will now always choose the port that is active when following
      dependencies that could be satisfied by more than one port and more than
      one of these is installed, instead of choosing the one actually named in
      the depspec. (#23921, jmr in r60883)

    - Extracting from a disk image ("use_dmg yes") no longer fails when there
      is a space in $worksrcdir. (#23456, raimue in r67089)

    - Added a configure.sdkroot option which can be used to build against a
      Mac OS X SDK. It is empty by default unless the value of
      macosx_deployment_target is not the current OS version, or the universal
      variant is set and the current platform is PowerPC Tiger. It is also
      possible to set macosx_deployment_target globally in macports.conf now,
      but this is unsupported. (#19875, jmr in r66924)

    - Add "fs-traverse -tails" which only returns the part following the
      specified directory (#21873, raimue in r65785)

    - Allow gcc45 port to be used in configure.compiler (ryandesign in r62223)

    - svn checkouts now use peg revisions instead of operative revisions,
      so they'll continue to work if a repository gets reorganized
      (#20777, ryandesign in r60573)

    - Print the location of the log file when a target fails (jmr in r60769)

    - Use CommonCrypto/CommonDigest instead of OpenSSL libcrypto.
      (toby in r58131, jberry in r59715)

    - New "patch.type gnu" for GNU patch, similar to "build.type gnu"
      for GNU make. Only makes a difference for BSD patch and BSD make.
      (afb in r58020)

    - Updated the FreeBSD package (ObjC/Foundation is now optional).
      (afb in r57889)

    - Don't use "make -j1" for build.jobs=1, but prefer "make" instead.
      (afb in r57998)

    - Add new "use_xz yes" port option to allow distfiles in xz format.
      (afb in r57827)

    - Archive mode now uses build_arch in archive names rather than os.arch.
      (snc in r58977)

    - Add new log command and keeping of debug output for easy access
      after port has run (GSoC 2009 logging project by enl, merged in r60372)

    - Some of the build_arch flags now appear in LDFLAGS as well, fixing
      several ports when building for a different architecture (jeremyhu in
      r60662, jmr in r60680)

    - Fixed 'merge' proc for paths with spaces, and for symlinks on Snow
      Leopard, and added an error message for when 'merge' is not called
      correctly (#21852, ryandesign in r58776, r58777, r58778)

Release 1.8.2 (2010-01-01 by jmr):

    - Fixed 'port load' for non-root installations (#21713, jmr in r60774)

    - Fixed a bug that could cause port to hit the open file limit
      (#22959, jmr in r61770)

    - Fixed an error when installing from source or selfupdating on Tiger with
      an svn-based ports tree (#20760, jmr in r61302)

    - Fixed an error when selfupdating as root with a prefix that is not owned
      by root (#21010, jmr in r60798)

    - Stopped uninstall from failing when files in the port image have already
      been deleted (#22001, jmr in r59318, r59654)

    - Stopped printing command output multiple times on failure (#21084,
      jmr in r60770)

    - Started showing bug reporting instructions on failure (jmr in r60770)

    - Fixed a bug where 'port dmg' could create too small an image and run out
      of space (#22404, jmr in r60260)

    - Fixed a bug where reinplace could fail when running port without root
      privileges (#20896, jmr in r59597)

    - Started setting our own umask since Snow Leopard makes us inherit
      the user's even when using sudo (#21389, jmr in r59585)

Release 1.8.1 (2009-09-28 by jmr):

    - Installer error messages now display properly even from the Snow Leopard
      MacPorts dmg. (jmr in r56448)

    - 'fetch.type svn' no longer requires the installation of the subversion
      port as of Snow Leopard. (toby in r56160; raimue in r56162)

    - Updated manpages and 'port help' output (ryandesign in r56472, r56473,
      r56474; blb in r56666, r57048, r57131)

    - Fixed syncing using the daily tarball. (#21034, toby in r56889)

    - Fixed 'port load' (#21128, raimue in r57055)

    - Improved error message when an expression on the command line does not
      match any ports (jmr in r57026)

    - Stopped recording the completion of the install phase in the
      statefile, which led to errors if the port was uninstalled but the work
      dir was not cleaned, and the port was then installed again.
      (jmr/raimue in r57801, 57820)

Release 1.8.0 (2009-08-28 by jmr):
    - There is now a 'build_arch' variable, available in portfiles and
      configurable in macports.conf, which sets the CPU architecture that
      ports should be compiled for (when not building universal). Its default
      is the same as that of the Apple-supplied /usr/bin/gcc.
      (#19874, jmr in r53217,r53386,r53420,r53494,r53860,r54236)

    - MacPorts base now works on and has appropriate default settings for
      Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. (#19874, toby/mww/jkh in r38271,r40060,
      r40836,r43976,r52397)
      
    - MacPorts now requires Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger or later. (Panther is not
      just "unsupported", it really won't work.)

    - The universal_sysroot and universal_target keys have been removed from
      macports.conf. These settings are now handled automatically.
      (toby in r52324)

    - Added a 'replaced_by' portfile option. This causes upgrade to deactivate
      the current port and install the port specified by this option. This
      also allows ports to be renamed. Upgrade accepts a --no-replace option
      which disables this behaviour. (#20157, jmr in r54378)

    - The upgrade action now accepts --force and --enforce-variants options.
      The former causes ports to be rebuilt even if they are not outdated, and
      the global -f option no longer has this effect (it had too many effects
      already). The latter causes ports to be rebuilt if the requested
      variants do not match those installed (even if they are not outdated).
      (#20156, jmr in r54376)

    - Dependencies can be satisfied by ports that are installed but not
      available in the ports tree (useful for testing uncommitted ports).
      (jmr in r52075, r52160)

    - Ports that are installed but not available in the ports tree no longer
      cause an error when running commands like 'port clean installed'. They
      are skipped and a warning is printed. (#19253, jmr in r50865)

    - Selfupdate no longer disables readline support unless readline is found
      in /usr/local, which has historically caused failures.
      (#19035, jmr in r50868)

    - Uninstalling a port that is not installed now produces an informational
      message rather than an error. (#18984, jmr in r53709)

    - Added a 'conflicts' portfile option. Conflicting ports will be detected
      during dependency calculation. (#18794, blb/jmr in r51525)

    - 'port selfupdate' now explicitly states precisely what it does. (#18512)

    - Operating system and architecture information is now shown in debug
      output. (#18435, raimue in r46669)

    - Fixed a bug that could break some symlinks to man pages. (#18302)

    - Switched to a more efficient algorithm for looking up port information
      in the index, which makes many operations faster.
      (#18259, jmr/blb in r47110)

    - MacPorts base now tries to avoid using commands that come from ports, so
      that a broken port can't break the base code. (#18149)

    - Deleting all the contents of a portfile option no longer unsets the
      option entirely. (#17865, toby in r44901)

    - Removed the code that upgrades from the old DarwinPorts filesystem
      layout. Trying to upgrade to 1.8.0+ from a version older than 1.5.0 will
      produce an error message saying you need to install 1.7.1 first.
      (#17619, jmr in r53260)

    - port(1) now reports its version as dotted-decimal rather than floating
      point. (#17420)

    - Dependencies are now always obtained by parsing the Portfile and not
      from the PortIndex, since the latter can't provide expanded variables
      like $prefix which may be used in path: depspecs. (#17182)

    - Newline characters in long_description can no longer cause receipt
      corruption. (#16619, blb in r50663)

    - Now unlocking the filemap when it is not in use. This allows e.g.
      'port contents' to be run while another port instance is performing
      installs. Note that running more than one simultaneous port instance
      that will modify the registry can easily fail, though hopefully
      without corrupting anything. (#16246, jmr in r51133)

    - Removed some irrelevant debug output that was being printed when a port
      failed. (#16203, jmr in r53706)

    - Added new depends_fetch and depends_extract options, for dependencies
      that are needed to fetch or extract the port, respectively.
      (#15161, jmr in r51780)

    - Packages (including the one for MacPorts base) now correctly indicate
      that they can only be installed on the root volume.
      (#14809, jmr in r53250)

    - Using an alternative fetch or extract type now adds appropriate
      dependencies automatically, e.g. 'use_zip yes' adds a dep on unzip, and
      'fetch.type svn' adds a dep on subversion. (#13981, jmr in r43782)

    - port(1) should now exit with an appropriate status code when an error is
      encountered. Use the -p option to continue despite errors.
      (#13918, jmr in r53704)

    - Proxy information can now be obtained from System Preferences and from
      macports.conf. The older method using environment variables no longer
      works out of the box on Leopard due to changes that Apple made to the
      default /etc/sudoers. (#13158, blb in r47194)

    - Improved handling of malformed variant definitions.
      (#12596, jmr in r50719, r50721)

    - Cope a little better with missing receipt files. (#19540, jmr in r51138)

    - Fixed a major memory leak in the filemap code.
      (#12022, pguyot in r51419)

    - Improved the logic for determining whether phases can be skipped. This
      fixes the specific problems of being unable to build packages of ports
      that are installed, port not running specific phases (e.g. build)
      when told to if the port is installed, and inactive dependencies being
      rebuilt instead of simply activated. (#10881, #16260, jmr in r50490)

    - When archive mode is enabled, ports will no longer be rebuilt if an
      archive is available. (#10785, jmr in r50416)

    - Activating a port will now first deactivate any other version of the
      same port that is already active. (#10571, jmr in r53711)

    - Added a 'license' portfile option, which is displayed in 'port info'
      output. (#7493, jmr in r50801)

    - port lint recognizes new top-level category php (#19329, ryandesign)

    - Do not print header lines when the quiet option -q is set
      (raimue in r48558)

    - svn.tag is deprecated, use svn.revision instead (raimue in r48222-48223)

    - port -i option has been removed (blb in r48218)

    - ui_warn logs to stderr instead of stdout (raimue in r48217)

    - Remove --pretend option for port selfupdate, use global dry-run option
      instead (raimue in r48125)

    - port(1) option -y for dry-run (#11892, gwhitney/jmr in r43726) 

    - New pseudo-port 'obsolete' to identify ports which are installed but no
      longer in the PortIndex (raimue in r47253)

    - MacPorts can now perform fetch, extract, patch, configure and build in a
      user rather than system owned location. By default, this is
      ~/.macports/opt. This allows MacPorts to do all but the install of the
      port without root privileges. (gsoc08-privileges)

    - MacPorts can now automatically drop privileges so as to avoid running as
      root whenever possible. To enable this, pass the desired user to run as
      to configure with the --with-macports-user option. (gsoc08-privileges)

    - The Portfile format has a number of new boolean attributes to indicate
      when an action should or should not be run with root privileges:
      'patch.asroot', 'build.asroot', 'configure.asroot', 'destroot.asroot',
      and 'install.asroot'. The default for all is "no". If the prefix folder
      (by default /opt/local) is not writable, MacPorts will attempt to
      elevate privileges to root for the install phase. (gsoc08-privileges)

    - A "make group" command has been added to the Makefile and a
      "--with-shared-directory" switch to the configure script. Running "make
      group" will create a macports group. "--with-shared-directory" will let
      let the group specified by "--with-install-group" have full read write
      access to the /opt/local hierarchy. This will allow users who are
      members of the new macports group to have full write permissions to
      /opt/local and its subfolders, and hence to install ports which only
      affect that hierarchy without requiring root privileges.
      (gsoc08-privileges)

    - A switch called "--with-no-root-privileges" has been added for use by
      user installing MacPorts for their own use only. An example configure
      command would be "./configure
      --prefix=/Users/{your-user-name-here}/.macports/opt
      --with-no-root-privileges" (gsoc08-privileges)

    - Add several new options to port search, looks in name and description by
      default (#15434, raimue)

    - Add xpkg package type, xar-based format with XML. (afb)

    - Split portpkg creation out from portsubmit phase. (afb)

    - Make dependencies displayed in port info respect variants
      specified in variants.conf; collapse port deps to be an alias
      for port info with appropriate flags. Note this changes output
      format of port deps somewhat.  (#11891, gwhitney in r44340)

    - Make dependencies in port upgrade respect variants as specified
      (in order of precedence) on command line, latest installed
      version, or variants.conf .  (#8221, gwhitney in r44362)

    - Add select action, which integrates *_select tools into port.
      (#17477, perry)

    - The variants action additionally shows default variants, conflicting
      variants and variants' dependencies. (#14178, #15628, perry)

    - Implicit variants (e.g., darwin) can no longer be explicitly
      set/unset. (#12563, perry in r46938, jmr in r53371)

Release 1.7.1 (2009-03-28 by raimue):
    - Trailing slashes are stripped from the prefix passed to configure, which
      prevents incorrect mtree violation warnings. (#13789)

    - Fix freshmeat-based livecheck (#18887)

    - Fix issue on direct-mode installs where checking for installed ports
      wasn't properly looking (it only matched for revision 0 and no
      variants) (#17762)

    - Add new "use_7z yes" port option to allow distfiles in 7z format
      (#18521, ryandesign)

    - port lint no longer requires variable master_sites if the port has no
      distfiles (#18479, ryandesign)

    - Upgrade will no longer accept ports that are not installed (but it still
      installs new ports as dependencies if needed). In particular, this means
      that "port upgrade all" will no longer proceed to install every
      available port. (jmr in r46052)

    - Add mkdtemp Tcl command to create temporary directories. (#17181, perry)

    - Add 'apple-gcc-4.2' option to configure.compiler (#18426, ryandesign)

    - Create ${applications_dir} and ${frameworks_dir} in destroot
      automatically (r45614, raimue)

    - Make the postflight procedure a bit smarter about which login files
      to update for bash and tcsh (#17588)

    - Add error messages to package installers when the wrong OS package
      is being installed (#13141)

Release 1.7.0 (2008-12-13 by blb):
    - Global variant descriptions using variant_descriptions.conf in the new
      resources directory in the ports tree (#14482, raimue)

    - Move port resources into the ports tree (#14553, raimue and blb)

    - Improve error message when "upgrade outdated" is used (#12288)

    - Properly handle ports whose version evaluates to 0 (#16740, ryandesign)

    - PortIndex is now regenerated atomically (#16234, blb & ryandesign)

    - Improve upon 'port lint' usage by not being too overbearing unless
      --nitpick is used (#14799)

    - Fix reinplace when the filename contains spaces (#17098, ryandesign)

    - Fix python port group issues (#15226)

    - Make sure global variants (from variants.conf) are applied to all
      phases (#11897)

    - Allow configuring --without-objc-runtime --without-objc-foundation,
      for building on platforms without Foundation like +puredarwin (r41015)

    - Changes in loading of configuration files. Currently the global
      configuration file is loaded first, then user defined one (if present),
      PORTSRC environment variable is loaded last. Last defined value is used
      for each configuration option. (#16329, contributed by Adam Byrtek)

    - Ruby port group now accepts a new (optional) last parameter for the
      ruby.setup command, "implementation". It is "ruby" by default, and
      can be set to "ruby19". It names the ruby-implementing port, and can
      possibly support still other rubys in the future. (#15912, febeling
      in r38683)

    - Don't use build.nice for complex build.cmd commands (#16091)

    - The buildmakejobs setting now also affects ports using the scons build
      system, so now scons-based ports can be built in parallel too. Previously
      only automake-based ports were supported. (ryandesign in r38556)

    - User-supplied port names are now treated in a fully case-insensitive
      manner. This fixes a bug where giving the name with incorrect case when
      deactivating/uninstalling would cause all the port's files to be left
      behind. (#11759, jmr/raimue in r37349, r37621)

    - The non-verbose output for the build phase no longer shows what target
      was used. This makes the build phase consistent with the other phases
      which also do not show details. If details are desired, the debug or
      verbose switches should be used. (#15881, raimue/ryandesign in r38315)

    - Make missing sed extended regexp (for reinplace -E) into a runtime error.
      (#15577, afb in r37501)

    - More helpful strings for 'port help' (needs more work #15467, raimue)

    - Command line options are checked if the command accepts it before
      running (raimue)

    - We now have a mirror of (almost) all distfiles at distfiles.macports.org,
      and it is automatically appended to master_sites and patch_sites (#15456,
      jmr in r37217, r37255)

    - port search looks now in name, description and long_description for the
      search pattern and prints the list sorted (#15434, raimue in r37119,
      r37121)

    - Stopped 'port -R upgrade' from processing more ports than it should, and
      from processing ports multiple times. (#10827, jmr in r37046)

    - Don't include build.nice and build.jobs in destroot.cmd (#15295)

    - The default universal variant is no longer added when we know it won't
      work. (#12170, jmr in r36764)

    - During upgrade, if the latest installed version of a port is not active,
      the currently active version (if any) is now deactivated before trying
      to activate the latest version. (#12013, jmr in r36762)

    - A port with dependents can now be removed without forcing iff it is
      inactive and there is at least one other version of the same port
      installed (#11501, jmr in r36747)

    - Duplicate entries can no longer build up in the dependency map (#8763,
      jmr in r36745)

    - In image mode, dependencies are no longer treated as being satisfied
      when the satisfying port is not active (#7361, jmr in r36735)

    - Fixed a bug where upgrade could create too many nested subdirectories
      in distpath, archive.destpath and unarchive.srcpath (#11971, jmr in
      r36679, r36687, r36688)

    - Declaring a dependency on a nonexistent port now always causes an error
      (#10768, jmr in r36648)

    - Explicitly use unsetenv(3) on all environment variables (#13930, #16010,
      #16233)

    - Make the included tclthread compile on Leopard if configured (#13495)

    - Allow distfiles to be disk images with "use_dmg yes" port option (#13509,
      ryandesign in r36708)

    - ruby.setup now takes a type 'fetch' to just fetch/extract (eridius in r35773)

    - Fetch now prefers mirrors with lower ping times (#14891, jmr in r35748,
      r35806, r35808)

    - Fetching of daily snapshot tarballs of the ports tree as an alternative to rsync
      (raimue in r35647, r35648)

    - port uninstall now takes --follow-dependents to uninstall all dependents
      (#14637, eridius/raimue in r34977, r35042, r36160)

    - New fetch.type git (#14232, eridius in r34875)

    - fixed "port mdmg" getting block size wrong for the disk image (#13968, afb in r34844)

    - always set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET, to avoid bugs with older glibtool (afb in r34541)

    - port lint now checks all dependencies so that the ports actually exist (#14380)

    - added target_state to avoid the need for privileges for lint/livecheck (#13458)

    - Overhauled output for port info/deps/dependents/search (raimue in
      r34354, r34371, r34391, r34395, r34402, r34420)

    - Revert the default +universal MDT/SDK to 10.4/10.4u on Tiger and 10.5/10.5 on Leopard

    - port lint shouldn't require variable master_sites for fetch.type != standard (#14377)

    - Add "tcldoc" documentation comments and "tcldox" Doxyfile for doxygen (#12048)

    - Add --pretend and --nosync flags to selfupdate (raimue in r33938, r33939,
      r33940, r33941)

    - Work around autoconf X11 detection bugs on darwin (afb in r33717)

    - Fix bugs with X11 lib detection on Leopard (#14089, afb in r33716)

    - Add configure.{optflags,m32,m64,march,mtune} (afb in r33503, r33599)

    - Add applications_dir and frameworks_dir configuration (r33499, r33722)

    - Remove some hardcoded paths (such as /usr/X11R6, /usr/bin/install) (afb in r33501, r33619, r33620)

    - Add configure.{universal_target,universal_sysroot,universal_archs} (afb in r33478).

    - Change default +universal platform back to: 10.4/10.4u.sdk/i386 ppc (r33087, r33107).

    - Add `port platform` info action that outputs current platform (#12302, afb in r32724).

    - Enable 64 bit environment, ppc64 x86_64, for all +universal builds (mww in r32194).

    - Add 'merge' function for merging multiple (single arch) destroots into one (universal)
      destroot (mww in r31954).

    - If checksum is mismatched, and in verbose mode, present a corrected pre-fabricated checksum statement
      to make it easy to update a port (jberry in r32441).

    - Fixed the "Error: Unable to open port: invalid command name "ui_prefix"" runtime error on Panther
      (eridius in r32525).

    - Fixed the "Error: Unable to open port: invalid command name "ui_channels"" runtime error on Panther
      (eridius in r32514).

    - "port lint" now recognizes non-canonical modelines (afb in r32480).

    - "configure.pipe" is now hackable from Portfiles (afb in r32430).

    - MacPorts no longer installs the "base/config/mp_version" file, as the release version is now stored
      internally in $macports::autoconf::macports_version (jmpp in r32353).

    - Bail out with a suitable message if the requested port is not installed when polling its dependents
      (jmpp in r32336).

    - Fixed a Panther build failure due to missing sqlite headers (jmpp in r32212).

    - Fixed a build failure by passing the base/src/cregistry/cregistry.a archive through ranlib (jmpp in r32105).


Release 1.6.0 (16-December-2007 by jmpp):

    - Revamped the postflight script that is run by Installer.app with our pkg installer to gracefully
      handle the addition of PATH, MANPATH and DISPLAY environment variables separately, if needed.
      Read http://guide.macports.org/#installing.binary.postflight.details for more information
      (jmpp in many commits directly on the release_1_6 branch).

    - Remove LD_PREBIND & LD_PREBIND_ALLOW_OVERLAP variables from MacPorts' environment to prevent
      prebinding of binaries, which can be harmful on Tiger and above (#13436, mww in r31786).

    - Add 'gcc-4.2' option to the configure.compiler Portfile command (mww in r31891).

    - Flush port(1) output channel after issuing prompt, when readline is not
      available, to ensure prompt is displayed at proper time. (jberry r31338).

    - readline is now disabled by default, in order to avoid support issues.
      use --enable-readine parameter to configure to enable support for readine.
      (#10651, jberry in r31139, r31140).

    - daemondo now monitors kevents for the death of the daemon process, which means that it
      now detects the death of processes (even those that aren't direct child processes)
      much more reliably. Plus other daemondo logging and doc cleanups.
      (jberry in r30313,r30332,r30333,r30334,r30335,r30364).

    - dramatic speedup to file, dir, url, work actions (jberry in r31056)

    - add option "extract.mkdir [no|yes]" for distfiles that would pollute ${workpath} with
      multiple files (mww in r31028)

    - add optional configure.pipe output (afb in r29604 & r30824)

    - add "startupitem_type none" macports.conf configuration option (#12743, afb in r30823)

    - add configure.[awk|bison|pkg_config|pkg_config_path] (r30761)

    - Auto-mode for number of parallel build threads (if number of jobs is set to "0") (r30739)

    - Add option use_parallel_build [yes|no] to declare if a port can be built in parallel (r30714).

    - New SourceForge.jp mirrors list (r30484).

    - Display warnings when using old versions of Mac OS X and Xcode Tools
      (#12794, afb in r30338 & r30477)

    - Remove configure.macosx_deployment_target, add global macosx_deployment_target
      (eridius in r30396).

    - add support for LZMA compression, for making .tlz archives (afb in r30307)

    - add configure.[perl|python|ruby] for interpreters, .install for avoiding breakage
      due to coreutils, .libs

    - added startupitem.netchange boolean flag (#12931, N_Ox in r30086).

    - added generic GNU livecheck (N_Ox in r29812).

    - fixed bug where all .mpkg packages were missing their welcome page (afb in r29517)

    - better defaults for implicit ui_channels behaviour (eridius in r29498).

    - prevent creating PKG packages with /etc or /var or /tmp (#2102, afb in r29445)

    - add optional configure.ccache and configure.distcc filters (#5390, afb in r29438)

    - Explicitly sort fs-traverse so it behaves predictably on Linux systems
      (#12622, eridius in r29412).

    - add configure.objc/objcflags for Objective-C

    - add optional build.nice (0) and build.jobs (1) modifiers (afb in r28634 & r28673)

    - make tclobjc1.0 compile with GNUstep and NXConstantString class (afb in r28668)

    - fix bsdmake/gnumake defaults for FreeBSD and Linux platforms (afb in r28660)

    - port lint command, for Portfile verification (#463, afb in r28170)

    - add configure.macosx_deployment_target for configure flags

    - add configure.javac/classpath for Java

    - add configure.fflags/fcflags/f90flags for Fortran flags

    - Mark "python" group code as deprecated

    - Add group code for Python 3.0

    - Add more compiler suites for the 'configure.compiler' option

    - `port variants` behaves like `port info` in that it parses the Portfile for up-to-date info.
      `port variants` also supports the --index flag (eridius in r27919).

    - Fix upgrade to properly handle installed versions beginning with letters (eridius in r27900).

    - Chris Pickel's GSoC2007 work: registry2.0 & cregistry (mainly r27518 & r27520)

    - Eugene Pimenov's GSoC2007 work: Trace lib on unix sockets (r26682).

    - Elias Pipping's GSoC2007 work: merge.rb on his personal /users/pipping svn dir.


Release 1.5.2 (15-August-2007 at branches/release_1_5's r27896, by jmpp):

    - Fix mtree checks which inaccurately complained about files in /Applications, /Library & /Developer;
      mtree checks now also warn the user if a port indicates an intended violation and errors are
      temporarily non-fatal (mww & eridius in r27709, r27710, r27719, r27720 & r27773).


Release 1.5.1 (11-August-2007 at branches/release_1_5/base's r27646, by jmpp):

    - Remove sed rules taking care of dp based comments in the macports.conf file from the upgrade target in base/Makefile.in,
      they were causing problems for people with /opt/dports or similar prefixes (jmpp in r27618).

    - Facelift to the PortIndex2MySQL.tcl script to make it selfcontained and work with the new macports1.0 api to
      generate SQL statements with information extracted from Portfiles (jmpp in r27415).

    - Always print the livecheck regex in debug mode, not only when it fails (ryandesign in r27379).

    - Detect some mtree violations within ${prefix}. Test can be overriden by "destroot.violate_mtree yes" in a Portfile
      (mww in r27199).

    - Fix version comparison in MacPorts initialization to properly detect Tcl versions 8.4.7 and later (sfiera in r27127).

    - Fix double de-escaping of livecheck.regex inadvertently introduced in r26041 (eridius in r27079).

    - Added new Portfile options to the configure stage for selecting compiler(s) (mww in r27018, r27021, r27022 and r27053)

    - New logic in the upgrade target to account for cases where the old and new versions consist of different
      numbers of segments (sfiera in r26921).

    - Remove dead OpenDarwin mirrors from our mirrors list (jmpp in r26903)

    - New tests for violations of common directory structure (and option to override them for special cases)

    - Added new variable ${os.major} that contains the Darwin major version (eridius r26693, ticket #12224).


Release 1.5.0 (09-July-2007 tagged at r26818 by jmpp):

    - Many documentation updates and improvements, mostly thanks to Maun Suang and Brian
      Campbell who both started work on both improving our man pages and reviving the
      long forgotten MacPorts official guide, now nightly regen'd on an automated basis
      and hosted at a temporary location, http://geeklair.net/macports_guide/, all
      thanks to Daniel J. Luke (dluke).

    - Improve built-in "daemondo" program logging (jberry r26537 & r26569).

    - rpm target now knows how to also build universal packages if requested (afb r26470).

    - The "rpmpackage" target was renamed to "rpm", and a new target "srpm" added
      that allows packaging a Portfile (and files/distfiles) up as a source package.
      Upgraded RPM to version 4.4.9 and changed OpenDarwin/DarwinPorts to MacPorts.
      The default build location is now ${prefix}/src/macports instead of ${prefix}/src/apple
      (jmpp & afb in r26465, r26496, r26536, r26543).

    - Fixed a potential crasher in the delete command (ticket #12149, eridius r26397).

    - 'port delete --work' now removes $portbuiltpath instead of $workpath, effectively prunning
      empty dirs that up until now were left behind in the build directory (jmpp r26394).

    - gnustep portgroup for gnustep-make-2.0 (yves r26266).

    - Adding backwards compatibility glue for clients of the public (darwin|mac)ports1.0 API
      that use now deprecated procs naming (DarwinPorts namespace) (jmpp r26392).

    - Merged the dp2mp-move branch into trunk to finally move away from all
      DarwinPorts related strings and conventions both internally and externally,
      implying big changes in MacPorts pathnames with respect to user visible stuff.
      Read http://trac.macports.org/projects/macports/wiki/MacPortsRenaming and
      http://trac.macports.org/projects/macports/log/branches/dp2mp-move/base for
      more full details and information (jmpp r26177).

    - Fix livecheck to properly de-escape livecheck.url (eridius r26041).

    - Add warning when it looks like PortIndex file is corrupt (eridius r26040).

    - Make portindex use stderr for errors (eridius r26038, ticket #11585).

    - Fix port variants calculation to properly account for negated variants and
      to detect problems between required and negated variants
      (ticket #11920, eridius r26036, patch by gwhitney).

    - Add global methods lpush, lpop, lshift, and lunshift. Works similar to
      lappend (in fact lpush is just lappend) and do what they sound like.
      Also add ldindex. Works like lindex, but deletes the element from the list.
      Documented in portfile.7 (eridius r26034).

    - Add global methods try and throw. Implemented based on the specification
      in TIP #89. Documented in portfile.7 (eridius r25979).

    - Handle encodings properly now. All Portfiles and .conf files are assumed
      to be utf-8, and reading them or calling portindex(1) should now work
      the same on all locales (ticket #11978, eridius r25975).

    - Add support for decoding of obscured maintainer addresses.
      We support two types of obscured addresses in Portfile maintainers field:
         (1) username ==> implies username@macports.org
         (2) subdomain.tld:username ==> implies username@subdomain.tld
      These are unobscured by port info, and by port submit during the submission process,
      but are left obscured in the Portfile to avoid accidental disclosure.
      (jberry r25795).

    - Update port.1 to reflect what "port dependents" really does (markd r25787, ticket #11898).

    - Distinguish a pseudo portname that evaluates to nothing from no arguments at all,
      improving behavior of 'installed', 'active', 'list', and 'search' pseudo portnames.
      (jberry in r25789, ticket #10674).

    - Bugfix startup item generation so that launchd.plists are disabled
      by default, as we claim they are in our documentation. (jberry r25785).

    - Update adduser/addgroup to use dscl instead of niutil. Also add support
      for realname key in addgroup (ticket #11012, eridius r25586).

    - Make a correction to port(1)'s determination of whether or not a port has
      been updated by making it compare ${version} and then ${revision} rather
      than a single comparison of the compound ${version}_${revision}; the
      latter reports 2.01_2 to be newer than 2.01.01a25_0 because, at the fifth
      character, `_' comes after `.' in ASCII lexicographic order.
      (boeyms in r25310)

Release 1.4.42 (17-May-2007 tagged at r25296 by jberry):

    - Fix reinplace, broken in 1.4.41 (eridius r25285).

Release 1.4.41 (16-May-2007 tagged at r25266 by jberry):

    - `port info` now supports new --index flag for using old behaviour (eridius r25256).

    - `port info` now opens the Portfile and displays up-to-date information.
      This allows information about variants to be displayed (e.g. dependencies).
      Also allow `port info` to default to current directory if no name is provided
      (eridius r25255).

    - Add -E flag to reinplace, does the same thing as in sed (eridius r25251).

    - Add support for [nosync] flag in sources.conf to prevent a source from syncing
      during a `port sync` or `port selfupdate` (eridius r25236).
      Example: file:///Users/landonf/misc/MacPorts/dports [nosync]

    - Updating a file: source via svn update during port sync now uses the uid/gid
      of the owner of the working copy (eridius r25142).

    - Make port(1) convert description and long_description from lists to
      strings before printing to stdout; this enables the proper printing of
      semi-colons, brackets and other characters by way of Tcl escape sequences.
      The exceptions to this are the sequences for newline and carriage return
      (these break the flatfile PortIndex format by introducing line breaks).
      (boeyms r25110)

    - Evaluate variants at dportopen instead of dportexec. This ensures that
      the portfile represents the proper information if queried before targets
      are executed. It also prevents variants from being executed twice if multiple
      targets are executed separately on the portfile (ticket #11296, eridius r25033).

    - Fix copy and move commands (eridius r25024).

    - Passing multiple arguments to $option-delete now works as expected
      (ticket #11929, eridius r25006).

    - fs-traverse no longer follows symlinks specified on the root. This fixes
      the incorrect behaviour of delete seen in #11862 (eridius r25003).

    - Remove bundled xar. (jberry r24913).

    - Tighten checking of port name in depspecs. neither + nor / is allowed.
      (jberry r24929, r24934, r24940).

    - Restore ability for portindex lines to contain carriage returns, allowing
      fields such as descriptions to contain line breaks. Note that any portindex
      containing such entries will not be readable by a recent version of macports.
      (jberry r25146)

    - Add support for descriptions on variants:
         * The syntax follows the syntax for variant depends, etc.
         * Descriptions for variants are entirely optional
         * The change to the portindex format to allow variant descriptions
           should be backwards compatible. Variant descriptions are stored,
           keyed by the variant name, in a new portinfo array named "variant_desc".

        Example:

            variant myvariant description "This variant does this and that" {
                configure.args-append   --do-this --do-that
            }

        (jberry r25147)

    - Only look for, or create, ~/.macports user directory if the HOME environment
      variable is defined. (jberry r25177)


Release 1.4.40 (7-May-2007, tagged at r24909 by jberry):

    - Note the bump in version naming. To leave ourselves lots of room in our versioning
      scheme, we've jumped from 1.4.3 to 1.4.40. The floating point represenation as
      reported by port version (1.440) will still be the same; we're just interpreting
      it differently.

    - variable tracing now works in a much better way and handles unsets properly.
      Similarly, ${option}-delete now works better. Depends validation no longer
      attempts to validate when the variable is unset. Additionally, the validation
      now actually validates each depspec instead of simply finding a single spec
      within the list that works (ticket #11868, eridius r24678).

    - macports infrastructure now easier to use from scripts.
      ui_prefix and ui_channels have default implementations, and
      all arguments to dportinit are now optional (ticket #11837, eridius r24460).

    - ln now accepts combined flags (ex. ln -sf foo bar) (eridius r24452)

    - default_variants now handles multiple values correctly (ticket #11828, eridius r24450).

    - ln uses new symlink command so it can create symlinks that point to
      files that don't actually exist (eridius r24444).

    - New bare-bones Pextlib command `symlink source target` (ticket #11840, eridius r24444).

    - delete reimplemented using fs-traverse (eridius r24435).

    - fs-traverse now uses the fts(3) family of functions instead of readdir/opendir.
      This fixes a couple behavioral oddities, and makes deleting during traversal work on 10.3
      (ticket #11839, eridius r24423).

    - fs-traverse now takes a list of targets rather than a variable number of arguments
      (ticket #11836, eridius r24410).

    - Fixed a potential crasher in fs-traverse when showing error message
      (ticket #11827, eridius r24396, thanks sfiera).

    - Fixed a bug where livecheck failed on ports that do not define a homepage
      (ticket #11818, pguyot r24319).

    - Added the downloads section of our repo to the macports mirrors list (jmpp r24278).

    - Fixed a bug with the archive mode introduced with r23238 change (1.4.1)
      (pguyot r24273).

    - Trace mode now take dependencies into account when executing the activate
      phase. This fixes an unwanted warning when activating ports that depend
      on teTeX (pguyot r24199).

    - Support for mpwa submit through "port submit".
      This work is in progress. (jberry)
       - Expose autoconf XAR variable as portutil::autoconf::xar_path. (r24194).
       - Start to build portpkg.xar and meta data, hijacking Kevin's
         portsubmit.tcl. (r24195-24196).

    - Revise error messages in port image activation to use syntax that
      matches port(1). (jberry r24543, r24548).

    - Create new interp variable prefix_frozen, which is available to port phases
      even when the Portfile redefines prefix. (jberry r24848-r24849)

    - Search for prefix-relative commands in prefix_frozen rather than prefix.
      Affects port submit (xar) and port fetch (svn). (jberry r24849)

    - Always create a ~/.macports user directory if it doesn't yet exist. (jberry r24831)

    - Move port(1) readline history file to ~/.macports/history (jberry r24832, r24843)

Release 1.4.3 (17-Apr-2007):

    - Fix bug in launchd support, introduced in 1.4.2. Remove remnants of
      launchd enable flag which caused reversion to systemstarter in 1.4.2.
      (jberry r24151).

    - add functions 'backup' and 'lipo' along with some description
      to be used for lipo-based universal variants, tested with openssl.
      These functions should be considered test only for the time being,
      and should not yet be adopted widely by port authors.
      (pipping r24148).

Release 1.4.2 (16-Apr-2007):

    - New logic for variants overload that basically yields to listing only
      variant +universal on ports that redefine it (pguyot in 24100).

    - Implement brand new fs-traverse command in Pextlib.
      See portfile.7 for documentation (eridius in r24079, r24080, and r24112).

    - Add per-user preferences in ~/.macports/user.conf. This will be used
      for submitter information.
      Simplify selection of ports.conf file:
        - ~/.portsrc is no longer supported.
        - Search order for ports.conf is now:
            - PORTSRC
            - ~/.macports/ports.conf
            - ${prefix}/etc/ports.conf
          Only the first file found will be parsed and used.
       (jberry r24071, r24113, r24114)

    - Improvements on livecheck: fixed a report bug, improved ruby group
      default behavior (pguyot in r24026 and r24018)

    - Remove xar from the build. xar doesn't build on panther due to
      a libxml2 lib too old for xar requirements. We'll find another
      way to deal with xar, perhaps by requiring users to install the
      xar port when they need its services. (jberry r24107:r24108)

    - Remove configure switch for building launchd support. (jberry r24107:r24108)

    - Remove compatibility upgrade for conf files from
      darwinports 1.1 to 1.2. (jberry r24106).

Release 1.4.1 (14-Apr-2007):

    - Add responsive, reasonably fast http mirrors to openbsd group
      (pipping in r23343).

    - Resolved ticket #11637: livecheck incorrectly assumed that
      master_sites was set. (pguyot in r23329).

    - Add xar 1.4 into the build of MacPorts base. xar is now installed
      into /opt/local/, which will conflict with anybody who has the xar
      port installed. (jberry in r23687).

    - Add -I${prefix}/include -L${prefix}/lib to the default configure
      flags (pguyot in r23246 and r23291).

    - New options for configure flags (C|CPP|CXX|LD)FLAGS and logic to
      handle that and backward compatibility (pguyot in r23098, r23125,
      r23238, r23248 and r23249).

    - "port sync" now updates svn repos too (eridius in r22784).

    - Default +universal variant for configure-based ports (pguyot in
      r22313).

    - Fixed use of master_site in livecheck, added support for
      code.google.com checks, made the up to date message info (instead of
      debug) and improved debugging output with livecheck (eridius in
      r23888, r23889, r23890, r23894; pguyot in 23660)

    - Fixed a bug where running port test would not install dependencies
      when required. (pguyot in r23700)

    - New ruby portgroup option to specify the name of the module for
      gem-based ports. (pguyot in 23659)

    - New fetch option to ignore the SSL certificate when fetching from
      a secure site (default is to not ignore it). (pguyot in r23242)

    - Bugfix #11720. Fixes for variants.conf functionality. (jberry in
      r23967)


Release 1.4 (26-March-2007):

    - New gnupg mirrors list and general cleanups to varios other lists (pipping in r22979 through r22982,
      r22999, r23000 & r23037).

    - Python 2.4 & Python 2.5 group code now offer a "python.include" variable (mww in r22914 & r22953).

    - Resolved ticket #7563: The Pextlib curl command now sends a user agent, set to
      "MacPorts libcurl/[libcurl version]" (eridius in r22771).

    - Resolved ticket #11417: No longer touch the dep map file when opening it for reading (eridius in r22769).

    - Archivemode now supports both tbz2 & tbz binary archives naming variations (jmpp in r22584).

    - Add new alias 'registry_active' for registry::active so portfiles can check if another port is
      installed and activated (eridius in r22304).

    - Built-in 'find' command now always expects an expression as its first argument (jkh in r22048).

    - with_docs variant of GNUStep PortGroup ports now installs the latex2html port by default (yves in r22014).

    - Add new 'touch' & 'ln' portfile writing commands, their usage being similar to their BSD equivalents,
      along with 'move' and 'copy' shorthands for TCL's "file rename/copy" calls (eridius in r22007).

    - Fix a dangerous bug in parsing filenames with spaces in the 'delete' command, while reworking it
      to no longer be a plain 'system "rm -rf <path>"' call (eridius in r22007).

    - Checksum phase no longer deletes distfiles upon checksums mistmatch, eliminating "file not found"
      errors when a second run is attempted, thus making the need for a "port clean --dist" call more
      explicit before continuing (eridius in r21967).

    - Stating an empty key value in a Portfile now correctly clears it, as expected (eridius in r21950 & r21951).

    - Documentation updates to the ports.conf.5 and portfile.7 man pages (markd, jmpp and others I may
      be forgetting, sorry 'bout that, in r21998, referencing tickets #4905, #6880 & #10840).

    - /Applications/DarwinPorts --> /Applications/MacPorts migration in base for aqua ports
      (rhwood in r21852 and r21853, but other commits to this effect were also applied to trunk/dports)

    - New SourceForge mirrors redirector and a few fallback geographically distributed hardcoded ones
      to prevent disaster from happening, as suggested by Ross Turk (jkh in r21143 & jmpp in r21768).

    - GNUStep PortGroup improvements and full documentation in portgroup.7 (yves in r21764).

    - Xcode GroupCode improvements to ensure builds always take place inside the work dir (eridius in r21762).

    - New 'macports' mirrors list, with entries pointing to svn's /distfiles/<user> &
      /distfiles/general directories in our repo (eridius & jmpp in r21621).

    - Iterate in darwinports_fastload using glob instead of hardcoding the library names (eridius in r21585).

    - New Python 2.5 GroupCode (mww in r21451).

    - Set upgrade.target back to archive (from unarchive) (dluke in r21110).

    - rubyforge_gem fetch method for the Ruby PortGroup & livecheck support
      (pguyot in r20544 & r20834, respectively).

    - Resolved ticket #10843 (and probably #8229): initialize the portinfo array each time to improve
      'port deps' and 'port variats' output (jberry in r19992).

    - Resolved ticket #10766: improve error when no current port is available (jberry in r19665).

    - Resolved ticket #8723: better messages for port outdated (jberry in r19664).


Release 1.3.2 (9-Aug-2006):

    - Fixed a bug that prevented operation of port ed with some editors.
      The env wasn't being properly restored for the editor. (jberry)

    - Fixed a bug in the creation of the portf symlink. (jmpp)

    - Fixed a bug where port upgrade -uf fails because of the dirty upgrade
      code. (pguyot)

    - Port no longer warns when a shared distfile directory is emptied by a
      clean --dist or clean --all, it now prunes the directory instead. (pguyot)

    - Gem method of ruby portgroup now destroots from the worksrcdir, thus
      avoiding an unnecessary warning with -t. (pguyot)

    - Tell ld to look into /usr/local/lib when building port. This solves a
      problem occurring when a newer version of readline is installed in
      /usr/local. (pguyot)

    - Added gnustep portgroup support. (Bugzilla #8139) (yves)

    - Avoid sending Pragma: no cache when fetching files. (Bugzilla #8669)
      (josh_root, blb)

    - Changed Makefile logic to reconfigure/regenerate files when templates
      are modified. (pguyot)

    - Trace now forbids renaming files and directories as well as removing
      directories outside the sandbox. (pguyot)

    - Allow additional inserted libraries by keeping DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES
      variable. (pguyot)

    - Change some UI strings and documentation to read MacPorts, rather than
      DarwinPorts. The project is adopting the new name "MacPorts", and will
      be using the macports.org domain in the future.

Release 1.3.1 (31-Jul-2006):

    - Fixed a bug in livecheck sourceforge guess algorithm. (pguyot)

    - Fixed an incompatibility of darwintrace.c with MacOS X 10.3. Darwintrace.c
      now also compiles on Linux. (pguyot)

    - Fixed a bug introduced by a patch to the fetch code. Now, fetch target
      can really deal with patch files even if the main fetch method is CVS or
      SVN. (pguyot)

    - Fixed a bug, introduced in 1.3, that prevented -f selfupdate from forcing
      a build of the fetched sources. (jberry)

    - Fixed a bug, introduced in 1.3, that prevented -u uninstall from working.
      (jberry)

    - Fixed a bug in xcode portgroup. One variable used by the group conflicted
      with global variables in port base code. (pguyot)

    - Added a new test case for a cvs+remote patch file bug. (pguyot)

    - Added ruby gems support for ruby group. (rcavanaugh & pguyot)

    - Trace now forbids creation of directories outside the sandbox. (pguyot)

    - Additions to man page for port(1): (jberry)
       * new port options -F, -i, -x, -p
       * mention interactive and batch modes
       * document extensions to info command.

    - Archive mode is now disabled by default. (landonf)

    - The upgrade target now properly detects and uses a matching binary
      archive if found, an uninstall && install combination needed up till
      now to pick it up. (jmpp)

Release 1.3 (27-Jul-2006):

    - Fixed a bug where only the first word of configuration settings (in
      ports.conf) was processed. This bug affected the use of extra_env.
      (Bugzilla #9948) (pguyot)

    - Fixed a bug where environment variables governing proxy were not
      capitalized properly. (blb & jberry)

    - Fixed a bug where port outdated and port ugprade didn't work in direct
      mode. (Bugzilla 7719, 7721) (dluke & jberry)

    - Fixed several problems with iteration on ports. (jberry)

    - Fixed a bug where curl LDFLAGS weren't properly propagated. (landonf)

    - Fixed a bug where location update routine invoked when installing DP did
      not take the DESTDIR variable into account. (jmpp)

    - Fixed a bug where patchfiles specifications could not have suffixes to
      indicate the master site. (pguyot)

    - Fixed spelling in port(1) man page. (Bugzilla 8103) (pjenvey & jberry)

    - Fixed a typo and another problem in messages generated by port command.
      (Bugzilla 6706 & 6712) (deric & jmpp)

    - Fixed a typo in ports.conf. (matt & jmpp)

    - Fixed several problems with launchd support (Bugzilla 8372 & 10041)
      (jberry)

    - Fixed a bug preventing the use of libmd for checksums and added an
      informative compilation error if libcrypto and libmd cannot be found.
      (landonf)

    - Fixed a bug where thread2.6 Tcl library wasn't installed where DP is
      installed. (jmpp)

    - Fixed a bug in xcode PortGroup which prevented the use of a custom
      project path. (pguyot)

    - Fixed a bug in xcode PortGroup which made destroot to fail when there
      were spaces in the install path. (pguyot)

    - Fixed a bug in portfetch.tcl which failed to fetch patches when using
      CVS or SVN. (Bugzilla 5269) (yeled)

    - Added new command 'delete' for use in Portfiles instead of
      'file delete' and 'system "rm.."' (mww)

    - Added more information to porthier(7) about ${prefix}/var/db/dports.
      (olegb)

    - Updated Gnome, KDE and SourceForge mirror lists. (Bugzilla 8045, 9152)
      (rwhood, blb, olegb & pguyot)

    - Check earlier if there is no Portfile in a directory (especially when
      iterating). (jberry)

    - Split livecheck into distcheck and livecheck. Added two regular expression
      modes (one line, full file), set the default to check against freshmeat
      and defined the default for perl5 group. (pguyot)

    - Discover path to rsync at autoconf time. (jberry)

    - Mark CVS, TAR, GNUTAR, and RSYNC as additional precious variables that can
      be overridden in configure environment at time of configure to customize
      the location of these tools. Note that these tools are not found in the dp
      prefix, as PATH is sanitized of references to prefix. But you could
      override the precious variables to acheive that if you really want to
      shoot yourself. (jberry)

    - Set timeouts for curl transfers.  Some connections to sketchy mirror sites
      can hang forever otherwise. (jkh)

    - Shortened the time to upgrade with archive mode on by using archive as the
      target. (Bugzilla #7891) (dluke & jberry)

    - Added support for sqlite 3. (jberry)

    - Major update of the trace (-t) option (pguyot):
      * backported changes from darwinbuild's version of darwintrace, including
        several bug fixes.
      * cleaned up the code.
      * writing/creating and also unlinking a file outside allowed bounds are
        now blocked instead of being simply reported (previous version only
        reported creations).
      * fixed a bug where -t failed with X11 ports because ${prefix} got
        overwritten.

    - Added new native commands to handle privileges chores. (jberry)

    - Add batch/interactive mode. In interactive mode, use readline when it's available.
      Command and portname completion is available in interactive mode, as is readline
      history. (jberry) 2005-11-07,08

        * Add new option -F <filename> which specifies a command file to be
          read and processed. Multiple such options may be given to provide
          multiple command files. If filename is "-", then stdin is read.

        * Option -i is equivilant to -F -, which forces processing of standard
          input following any commands given as arguments.

        * If port is invoked as portf, an -F is assumed as an implicit first
          argument (so the real first argument is taken as a command file to
          be processed). This should allow the use of a shebang line such as:
            #!/usr/bin/env portf

        * Commands starting with # are treated as comments.

        * Install a symbolic link /opt/local/bin/portf --> /opt/local/bin/port.

        * New command "cd" is useful to change to a new directory/port while in
          interactive/batch mode.

        * Multiple commands on a single line may be separated by a ';'

        * Global command options may now be specified following a particular
          command; they will apply only to that command rather than to all
          command invocations. This is important for batch/interactive mode.

    - Add new option -p, which ignores errors while processing within a command.
      (this subsumes some of the work that -f was previously overloaded to do).
      (jberry).

    - Add new option -x, which exits immediately on errors while in batch mode (
      otherwise we don't exit on errors in batch mode). (jberry)

    - Refactoring of port(1) to cast actions into distinct action procs. Adds
      the new action_array which is used for action dispatch, and also to generate
      the list of possible commands for help and command completion. (jberry)

    - Initial version of portmirror binary to build a mirror of distfiles.
      (pguyot)

    - Improvements and fixes to the tests. (pguyot)

    - Added a new option (checksum.skip=yes) to bypass the checksum phase. This
      option is mostly useful on the command line to test older distfiles.
      (jberry)

    - Added dependencies for rpm on virtual packages representing releases of
      MacOS X. (mww)

    - Add to port the ability to query for specific meta-data fields.
      For instance: port info --maintainer --name category:java
      When specific fields are given, the legacy generalized info is not presented, and vis-versa.
      By default, the fields for each port are listed one-per-line, with a field label
      in front of each. (The field label is omitted if the global -q option is given).
      If the --line option is given, the fields are presented on one line, tab separated,
      and with no field label: port info --name --maintainer --line tomcat5 apache2
      Field names are those from the PortIndex, plus some convenience versions of
      those: (such as allowing category instead of categories).
      Fields which are actually lists (such as depends_lib) are displayed comma-separated.
      (jberry) 2006-02-16

Release 1.2.1 (10-Apr-2006):

    - Changes to darwinports build infrastructure to allow for build of
      the darwinports infrastructure as a multiarchitecture binary.
      This allows darwinports to be built as fat, but does nothing to
      allow ports themselves to be built as fat. To build darwinports
      fat, configure as follows:
        ./configure CFLAGS='-arch ppc -arch i386' SHLIB_LDFLAGS='-arch ppc -arch i386'
                                        backported from HEAD (jberry)

    - Add a hack in order attempt to detect when a sourceforge mirror
      is actually returning an error page. If this is detected, proceed
      to the next mirror.               backported from HEAD (jberry)

Release 1.2 (14-Dec-2005):

    - Syntax change to disambiguate uses of the port's version on the command
      line, when coupled with new changes to accept multiple ports.
      The port version must now always be prefixed with an @. Example:
        port uninstall vim @1.0
      This probably only affects uninstall and activate, both of which
      require a version if there are multiple versions installed.

    - gzip-compress manpages that are in the share/man/cat? directories during
      destroot, too. (mww)

    - Enhance port command such that targets that require a port to be
      specified will now all default to a port in current directory. (jberry)

    - Enhance port command to allow multiple ports per invocation.
      Where previously one said "port install porta; port install portb",
      one can now say "port install porta portb". (jberry)

    - Enhance port command to allow use of shell-like glob patterns for
      port selection. When a glob pattern is found, the group of ports
      matching the glob pattern is substituted. (jberry)

    - Enhance port command to allow use of "pseudo" portnames to specify
      groups of ports.
      When one of these pseudo portnames is specified on the command line,
      the corresponding group of ports is substituted.

      Currently defined pseudo portnames are:
        current, all, installed, uninstalled, active, inactive, outdated.

      Additional pseudo portnames can be used to select ports based on a
      regex pattern match against certain criteria. Each port selector is
      a name, followed by a colon, followed by the desired regex pattern.
      The selectors are:
      variants:, variant:, description:, portdir:, homepage:, epoch:,
      platforms:, platform:, name:, long_description:, maintainers:, maintainer:,
      categories:, category:, version:, and revision: (jberry)

    - Enhance port command to allow use of set expressions to combine
      ports or groups of ports.
      Supported operators are "and", "or", "not", "!", "(", ")". (jberry)

    - Enhance port command to allow a port to be specified through a file:
      url instead of via portname. This function was previously available
      though the -D and -u options, which make less sense now that multiple
      ports can be specified to a target. (jberry)

    - Under Tiger, startupitems are now by default generated for launchd
      rather than systemstarter. (jberry)

    - Add new startupitem keys startupitem.executable, startupitem.logfile,
      startupitem.logevents, startupitem.pidfile, supported for both
      systemstarter and launchd. (jberry)

    - New Test framework. Running make test from base/tests/ will test
      several features of port(1) including syntax of Portfiles. New tests
      can easily be added by simply creating new directories in base/tests/
      with a Portfile and a master file containing the output of port test
      in this directory. Some tests are actually more complex. These tests
      require the port binary to be installed in ${prefix}. (pguyot)

    - svn fetching support, parallel to cvs fetching. Note that
      this is a bit skanky as svn is not installed on the platform by default.
      This code will error-out if svn is not installed. (jberry)

    - Removal of old "fetch.args" parameter now that all Portfiles have been
      properly moved to leverage Paul's libcurl work (yeled)

    - DP now sets its own env variables instead of filtering user declared
      ones considered harmful (blb)

    - "Canonicalization" of expanded path:${prefix}/foo:bar dependencies
      when including them in the PortIndex for better abstraction (jberry/pguyot)

    - Addition of the IndexRegen.sh script that takes care of the automated
      index thingie... (pguyot and jmpp)

    - Miscellaneous cleanups:
        - DP base is assured to respect a temporary DESTDIR installation and
          other Makefile cleanups (toby, jmpp)
        - s/--with-tclpackagedir/--with-tclpackage/g in autoconf error
          reports (pguyot)
        - fixes for the buildall.sh script (jkh)

    - Some other fixes for lurking bugs, untapped by the various developments
      that have taken place since 1.1 ("bunch of developers ;-);

    - Snazzy new ChangeLog file

    - Add new actions for port(1): help (get help about port),
      echo (the expanded arguments),
      cat (the contents of the Portfiles from the specified ports),
      edit (also alias "ed", the contents of the Portfiles, using EDITOR or VISUAL),
      dir (emit path to the port's directory),
      file (emit path to the port's Portfile)
      (jberry)

    - On make install, upgrade ports.conf and sources.conf to change rsync.opendarwin.org
      to rsync.darwinports.org. This is now our preferred rsync hostname.
      Likewise, rename the rsync destination directories in ${prefix}/var/db/dports/sources
      in a similar fashion (jberry)
