# MacPorts rsync repos feeding the sync & selfupdate procedures, created and
# maintained by the base/portmgr/jobs/mprsyncup script.
# 
# Two main modules are supplied for current installations off the release branch
# and two for backwards compatibility (legacy DarwinPorts namespace). Assuming
# an RSYNCROOT path of /Volumes/data/rsync/macports/, this file is organized
# in the following four modules and filesystem level paths (server side):
#
#
# PATHS:
#
# ${RSYNCROOT}/release: holding a ports tree, exported from a checkout of svn's
# trunk/dports dir (ToT), and the current release base dir, as determined by
# the base/config/RELEASE_URL file that's read by base/portmgr/jobs/mprsyncup;
#
# ${RSYNCROOT}/trunk: holding an export of a checkout from svn's trunk/base
# dir (ToT);
#
# ${RSYNCROOT}/dpupdate: backwards compatible path & module, a filesystem
# level (relative) symlink to the trunk path above
#    (relative to ${RSYNCROOT}: dpupdate --> trunk);
#
# ${RSYNCROOT}/dpupdate1: backwards compatible path & module, a filesystem
# level (relative) symlink to the release path
#    (relative to ${RSYNCROOT}: dpupdate1 --> release).
#
# 
# Futhermore the ${RSYNCROOT}/trunk path must also hold a (relative) `dports'
# symlink to `../release/ports', so that a sync operation against
# `dpupdate/ports' for the ports tree works on legacy MacPorts installations
# (DarwinPorts namespace). Overall, the ${RSYNCROOT} skeleton should look like:
#
# release/
# release/base/
# release/ports/
# trunk/
# trunk/base/
# trunk/dports --> ../release/ports
# dpupdate --> trunk
# dpupdate1 --> release
#
#
# Whatever server uses this file to mirror MacPorts rsync repositories
# should simply adapt the ${RSYNCROOT} path variable as necessary (keeping
# it in sync with the equally named variable in base/portmgr/jobs/mprsyncup)
# and add the listed modules to an already tailored rsyncd.conf file,
# as no other particular configuration options are supplied. Repositories
# themselves are created and maintained by base/portmgr/jobs/mprsyncup, as stated
# above (that is, no manual intervention what-so-ever is needed, other than
# adding the repositories to the local rsyncd.conf file and installing
# base/portmgr/jobs/mprsyncup on cron/launchd).
#
# Lastly, it is required of every 3rd party mirrors to keep track of this script
# and the base/portmgr/rsync.repos file and always maintain local copies in as
# close sync as possible.
